> Methods for Using the GLM Coding Plan in Goose

Goose is an AI agent tool that supports local or desktop environments and offers a CLI interface. It integrates with multiple models and connects to external tools and APIs via the MCP protocol to automate engineering tasks such as code generation, debugging, testing, and deployment.

Goose is delivering a more stable and efficient functional experience with the [GLM Coding Plan](https://z.ai/subscribe?utm_source=zai\&utm_medium=link\&utm_term=devpack-integration\&utm_campaign=Platform_Ops&_channel_track_key=w3mNdY8g).
