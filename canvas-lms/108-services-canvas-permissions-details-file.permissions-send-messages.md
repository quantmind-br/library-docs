## Conversations - send messages to individual course members

Allows user to send messages to individual course members.

### Additional Considerations

When disabled, students can still send individual messages to course teachers, course TAs, and students that belong to the same account-level groups.

To edit a user’s section, Users - allow administrative actions in courses and Users - view list must also be enabled.
