Define reusable behavior via SKILL.md definitions

Agent skills let OpenCode discover reusable instructions from your repo or home directory. Skills are loaded on-demand via the native `skill` tool—agents see available skills and can load the full content when needed.

* * *

## [Place files](#place-files)

Create one folder per skill name and put a `SKILL.md` inside it. OpenCode searches these locations:

- Project config: `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Global config: `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Project Claude-compatible: `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Global Claude-compatible: `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

* * *

## [Understand discovery](#understand-discovery)

For project-local paths, OpenCode walks up from your current working directory until it reaches the git worktree. It loads any matching `skills/*/SKILL.md` in `.opencode/` and any matching `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` along the way.

Global definitions are also loaded from `~/.config/opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md` and `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

* * *

## [Write frontmatter](#write-frontmatter)

Each `SKILL.md` must start with YAML frontmatter. Only these fields are recognized:

- `name` (required)
- `description` (required)
- `license` (optional)
- `compatibility` (optional)
- `metadata` (optional, string-to-string map)

Unknown frontmatter fields are ignored.

* * *

## [Validate names](#validate-names)

`name` must:

- Be 1–64 characters
- Be lowercase alphanumeric with single hyphen separators
- Not start or end with `-`
- Not contain consecutive `--`
- Match the directory name that contains `SKILL.md`

Equivalent regex:

* * *

## [Follow length rules](#follow-length-rules)

`description` must be 1-1024 characters. Keep it specific enough for the agent to choose correctly.

* * *

## [Use an example](#use-an-example)

Create `.opencode/skills/git-release/SKILL.md` like this:

```

---
name: git-release
description: Create consistent releases and changelogs
license: MIT
compatibility: opencode
metadata:
audience: maintainers
workflow: github
---
## What I do
- Draft release notes from merged PRs
- Propose a version bump
- Provide a copy-pasteable `gh release create` command
## When to use me
Use this when you are preparing a tagged release.
Ask clarifying questions if the target versioning scheme is unclear.
```

* * *

OpenCode lists available skills in the `skill` tool description. Each entry includes the skill name and description:

```

<available_skills>
<skill>
<name>git-release</name>
<description>Create consistent releases and changelogs</description>
</skill>
</available_skills>
```

The agent loads a skill by calling the tool:

```

skill({ name: "git-release" })
```

* * *

## [Configure permissions](#configure-permissions)

Control which skills agents can access using pattern-based permissions in `opencode.json`:

```

{
"permission": {
"skill": {
"*": "allow",
"pr-review": "allow",
"internal-*": "deny",
"experimental-*": "ask"
}
}
}
```

PermissionBehavior`allow`Skill loads immediately`deny`Skill hidden from agent, access rejected`ask`User prompted for approval before loading

Patterns support wildcards: `internal-*` matches `internal-docs`, `internal-tools`, etc.

* * *

## [Override per agent](#override-per-agent)

Give specific agents different permissions than the global defaults.

**For custom agents** (in agent frontmatter):

```

---
permission:
skill:
"documents-*": "allow"
---
```

**For built-in agents** (in `opencode.json`):

```

{
"agent": {
"plan": {
"permission": {
"skill": {
"internal-*": "allow"
}
}
}
}
}
```

* * *

Completely disable skills for agents that shouldn’t use them:

**For custom agents**:

```

---
tools:
skill: false
---
```

**For built-in agents**:

```

{
"agent": {
"plan": {
"tools": {
"skill": false
}
}
}
}
```

When disabled, the `<available_skills>` section is omitted entirely.

* * *

## [Troubleshoot loading](#troubleshoot-loading)

If a skill does not show up:

1. Verify `SKILL.md` is spelled in all caps
2. Check that frontmatter includes `name` and `description`
3. Ensure skill names are unique across all locations
4. Check permissions—skills with `deny` are hidden from agents
