## Subscription FAQs

Table of contents

* * *

For more information on Docker subscriptions, see [Docker subscription overview](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/).

## [Can I transfer my subscription from one user or organization account to another?](#can-i-transfer-my-subscription-from-one-user-or-organization-account-to-another)

Subscriptions are non-transferable between accounts or organizations.

## [Can I pause or delay my Docker subscription?](#can-i-pause-or-delay-my-docker-subscription)

You can't pause or delay a subscription, but you can downgrade your subscription. If a subscription invoice isn't paid by the due date, there's a 15-day grace period starting from the due date.

## [Does Docker offer academic pricing?](#does-docker-offer-academic-pricing)

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact) for information about academic pricing options.

## [How can I contribute to Docker content?](#how-can-i-contribute-to-docker-content)

Docker offers two content contribution programs:

- [Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program (DSOS)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dsos-program/) for open source projects
- [Docker Verified Publisher (DVP)](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dvp-program/) for commercial publishers

You can also join the [Developer Preview Program](https://www.docker.com/community/get-involved/developer-preview/) or sign up for early access programs to participate in research and try new features.
