summary: This document explains the Docker host networking driver, detailing how containers share the host's network namespace to optimize performance and handle large port ranges. It provides configuration steps for Linux and Docker Desktop, along with specific usage examples and technical limitations.

If you use the `host` network mode for a container, that container's network stack isn't isolated from the Docker host (the container shares the host's networking namespace), and the container doesn't get its own IP-address allocated. For instance, if you run a container which binds to port 80 and you use `host` networking, the container's application is available on port 80 on the host's IP address.

> Given that the container does not have its own IP-address when using `host` mode networking, [port-mapping](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/drivers/overlay/#publish-ports) doesn't take effect, and the `-p`, `--publish`, `-P`, and `--publish-all` option are ignored, producing a warning instead:

Host mode networking can be useful for the following use cases:

- To optimize performance
- In situations where a container needs to handle a large range of ports

This is because it doesn't require network address translation (NAT), and no "userland-proxy" is created for each port.

The host networking driver is supported on:

- Docker Engine on Linux
- Docker Desktop version 4.34 and later (requires enabling the feature in Settings)

> For Docker Desktop users, see the [Docker Desktop section](#docker-desktop) below for setup instructions.

You can also use a `host` network for a swarm service, by passing `--network host` to the `docker service create` command. In this case, control traffic (traffic related to managing the swarm and the service) is still sent across an overlay network, but the individual swarm service containers send data using the Docker daemon's host network and ports. This creates some extra limitations. For instance, if a service container binds to port 80, only one service container can run on a given swarm node.

Host networking is supported on Docker Desktop version 4.34 and later. To enable this feature:

1. Sign in to your Docker account in Docker Desktop.
2. Navigate to **Settings**.
3. Under the **Resources** tab, select **Network**.
4. Check the **Enable host networking** option.
5. Select **Apply and restart**.

This feature works in both directions. This means you can access a server that is running in a container from your host and you can access servers running on your host from any container that is started with host networking enabled. TCP as well as UDP are supported as communication protocols.

### [Examples](#examples)

The following command starts netcat in a container that listens on port `8000`:

Port `8000` will then be available on the host and you can connect to it with the following command from another terminal:

What you type in here will then appear on the terminal where the container is running.

To access a service running on the host from the container, you can start a container with host networking enabled with this command:

If you then want to access a service on your host from the container (in this example a web server running on port `80`), you can do it like this:

### [Limitations](#limitations)

- Processes inside the container cannot bind to the IP addresses of the host because the container has no direct access to the interfaces of the host.
- The host network feature of Docker Desktop works on layer 4. This means that unlike with Docker on Linux, network protocols that operate below TCP or UDP are not supported.
- This feature doesn't work with Enhanced Container Isolation enabled, since isolating your containers from the host and allowing them access to the host network contradict each other.
- Only Linux containers are supported. Host networking does not work with Windows containers.

This example shows how to start an Nginx container that binds directly to port 80 on the Docker host. From a networking perspective, this provides the same level of isolation as if Nginx were running directly on the host, but the container remains isolated in all other aspects (storage, process namespace, user namespace).

### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- Port 80 must be available on the Docker host. To make Nginx listen on a different port, see the [Nginx image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/).
- The host networking driver only works on Linux hosts, and as an opt-in feature in Docker Desktop version 4.34 and later.

### [Steps](#steps)

1. Create and start the container as a detached process. The `--rm` option removes the container when it exits. The `-d` flag starts it in the background:
2. Access Nginx by browsing to [http://localhost:80/](http://localhost:80/).
3. Examine your network stack:
   
   Check all network interfaces and verify that no new interface was created:
   
   Verify which process is bound to port 80 using `netstat`. You need `sudo` because the process is owned by the Docker daemon user:
4. Stop the container. It's removed automatically because of the `--rm` option:
