We believe in transparency and want you to feel confident about your investment in Zencoder. That’s why we offer a 7-day free trial—letting you to explore our AI agents, test them with your codebase, and see the productivity gains firsthand before making any financial commitment.

Can I get a refund if I cancel my subscription early?

Since we provide a full-featured 7-day trial to help you make an informed decision, we don’t offer refunds for early cancellations. However, you’ll continue to have full access to all your plan’s features until your current billing period ends — so you can maximize the value of your investment.

If I downgrade my plan, do I get money back for the difference?

Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle, allowing you to fully utilize your current plan’s capabilities until then. While we don’t provide refunds for the difference, this approach ensures a smooth transition without service interruption.

Will I get a refund if my account is suspended or terminated?

To maintain a safe and productive environment for all users, accounts suspended or terminated due to policy violations are not eligible for refunds. We’re always here to help if you have questions about our usage policies.

What if Zencoder decides to close my account without any reason — do I get a refund?

Absolutely! In the unlikely event we need to close your account for reasons unrelated to policy violations, we’ll promptly refund you for any unused portion of your subscription. Your trust matters to us.

If I'm on a trial, do I need to pay anything?

Not at all! Our 7-day trial is completely free with no credit card required. You can explore all features, integrate with your tools, and experience the full power of Zencoder before deciding whether to upgrade or continue with our free plan.

Do I get a refund if the service has technical issues or downtime?

While we don’t offer refunds for service interruptions, our team works around the clock to maintain 99.9% uptime and resolve any issues swiftly. We’re committed to keeping your development workflow running smoothly.

Can I pause my subscription and resume later?

We don’t currently offer subscription pausing, but many developers find our free plan perfect for maintaining access during breaks. When you’re ready to dive back in, upgrading takes just a few clicks.

If prices increase while I'm subscribed, can I get a refund?

Good news — you’re protected from price increases during your current subscription term! Any pricing changes only affect future renewals, and we’ll always notify you well in advance.

Can I get a partial refund if I didn't use the service much?

We don’t offer refunds based on usage. Whether you use the service a little or a lot, the subscription fee remains the same for the term. Our subscription model provides access to help you work at your own pace. Whether you’re coding daily or tackling weekend projects, the value is there when you need it. That’s why we encourage using the free trial to ensure Zencoder fits your workflow.
