## Integrate Docker Scout with Microsoft Azure DevOps Pipelines

The following examples runs in an Azure DevOps-connected repository containing a Docker image's definition and contents. Triggered by a commit to the main branch, the pipeline builds the image and uses Docker Scout to create a CVE report.

First, set up the rest of the workflow and set up the variables available to all pipeline steps. Add the following to an *azure-pipelines.yml* file:

```
trigger:- mainresources:- repo:selfvariables:tag:"$(Build.BuildId)"image:"vonwig/nodejs-service"
```

This sets up the workflow to use a particular container image for the application and tag each new image build with the build ID.

Add the following to the YAML file:

```
stages:- stage:BuilddisplayName:Build imagejobs:- job:BuilddisplayName:Buildpool:vmImage:ubuntu-lateststeps:- task:Docker@2displayName:Build an imageinputs:command:builddockerfile:"$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/Dockerfile"repository:$(image)tags:|                $(tag)- task:CmdLine@2displayName:Find CVEs on imageinputs:script:|                # Install the Docker Scout CLI
                curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/scout-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s --
                # Login to Docker Hub required for Docker Scout CLI
                echo $(DOCKER_HUB_PAT) | docker login -u $(DOCKER_HUB_USER) --password-stdin
                # Get a CVE report for the built image and fail the pipeline when critical or high CVEs are detected
                docker scout cves $(image):$(tag) --exit-code --only-severity critical,high
```

This creates the flow mentioned previously. It builds and tags the image using the checked-out Dockerfile, downloads the Docker Scout CLI, and then runs the `cves` command against the new tag to generate a CVE report. It only shows critical or high-severity vulnerabilities.
