## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- Complete all the previous sections of this guide, starting with [Use containers for Python development](https://docs.docker.com/guides/python/develop/).
- [Turn on Kubernetes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/kubernetes/#enable-kubernetes) in Docker Desktop.

## [Overview](#overview)

In this section, you'll learn how to use Docker Desktop to deploy your application to a fully-featured Kubernetes environment on your development machine. This allows you to test and debug your workloads on Kubernetes locally before deploying.

## [Create a Kubernetes YAML file](#create-a-kubernetes-yaml-file)

In your `python-docker-dev-example` directory, create a file named `docker-postgres-kubernetes.yaml`. Open the file in an IDE or text editor and add the following contents.

```
apiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:postgresnamespace:defaultspec:replicas:1selector:matchLabels:app:postgrestemplate:metadata:labels:app:postgresspec:containers:- name:postgresimage:postgres:18ports:- containerPort:5432env:- name:POSTGRES_DBvalue:example- name:POSTGRES_USERvalue:postgres- name:POSTGRES_PASSWORDvalueFrom:secretKeyRef:name:postgres-secretkey:POSTGRES_PASSWORDvolumeMounts:- name:postgres-datamountPath:/var/lib/postgresqlvolumes:- name:postgres-datapersistentVolumeClaim:claimName:postgres-pvc---apiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:name:postgresnamespace:defaultspec:ports:- port:5432selector:app:postgres---apiVersion:v1kind:PersistentVolumeClaimmetadata:name:postgres-pvcnamespace:defaultspec:accessModes:- ReadWriteOnceresources:requests:storage:1Gi---apiVersion:v1kind:Secretmetadata:name:postgres-secretnamespace:defaulttype:Opaquedata:POSTGRES_PASSWORD:cG9zdGdyZXNfcGFzc3dvcmQ=# Base64 encoded password (e.g., 'postgres_password')
```

In your `python-docker-dev-example` directory, create a file named `docker-python-kubernetes.yaml`. Replace `DOCKER_USERNAME/REPO_NAME` with your Docker username and the repository name that you created in [Configure CI/CD for your Python application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/python/configure-github-actions/).

```
apiVersion:apps/v1kind:Deploymentmetadata:name:docker-python-demonamespace:defaultspec:replicas:1selector:matchLabels:service:fastapitemplate:metadata:labels:service:fastapispec:containers:- name:fastapi-serviceimage:DOCKER_USERNAME/REPO_NAMEimagePullPolicy:Alwaysenv:- name:POSTGRES_PASSWORDvalueFrom:secretKeyRef:name:postgres-secretkey:POSTGRES_PASSWORD- name:POSTGRES_USERvalue:postgres- name:POSTGRES_DBvalue:example- name:POSTGRES_SERVERvalue:postgres- name:POSTGRES_PORTvalue:"5432"ports:- containerPort:8001---apiVersion:v1kind:Servicemetadata:name:service-entrypointnamespace:defaultspec:type:NodePortselector:service:fastapiports:- port:8001targetPort:8001nodePort:30001
```

In these Kubernetes YAML file, there are various objects, separated by the `---`:

- A Deployment, describing a scalable group of identical pods. In this case, you'll get just one replica, or copy of your pod. That pod, which is described under `template`, has just one container in it. The container is created from the image built by GitHub Actions in [Configure CI/CD for your Python application](https://docs.docker.com/guides/python/configure-github-actions/).
- A Service, which will define how the ports are mapped in the containers.
- A PersistentVolumeClaim, to define a storage that will be persistent through restarts for the database.
- A Secret, Keeping the database password as an example using secret kubernetes resource.
- A NodePort service, which will route traffic from port 30001 on your host to port 8001 inside the pods it routes to, allowing you to reach your app from the network.

To learn more about Kubernetes objects, see the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).

> Note
> 
> - The `NodePort` service is good for development/testing purposes. For production you should implement an [ingress-controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/).

## [Deploy and check your application](#deploy-and-check-your-application)

1. In a terminal, navigate to `python-docker-dev-example` and deploy your database to Kubernetes.
   
   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f docker-postgres-kubernetes.yaml
   ```
   
   You should see output that looks like the following, indicating your Kubernetes objects were created successfully.
   
   ```
   deployment.apps/postgres created
   service/postgres created
   persistentvolumeclaim/postgres-pvc created
   secret/postgres-secret created
   ```
   
   Now, deploy your python application.
   
   ```
   kubectl apply -f docker-python-kubernetes.yaml
   ```
   
   You should see output that looks like the following, indicating your Kubernetes objects were created successfully.
   
   ```
   deployment.apps/docker-python-demo created
   service/service-entrypoint created
   ```
2. Make sure everything worked by listing your deployments.
   
   ```
   $ kubectl get deployments
   ```
   
   Your deployment should be listed as follows:
   
   ```
   NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   docker-python-demo   1/1     1            1           48s
   postgres             1/1     1            1           2m39s
   ```
   
   This indicates all one of the pods you asked for in your YAML are up and running. Do the same check for your services.
   
   You should get output like the following.
   
   ```
   NAME                 TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
   kubernetes           ClusterIP   10.43.0.1      <none>        443/TCP          13h
   postgres             ClusterIP   10.43.209.25   <none>        5432/TCP         3m10s
   service-entrypoint   NodePort    10.43.67.120   <none>        8001:30001/TCP   79s
   ```
   
   In addition to the default `kubernetes` service, you can see your `service-entrypoint` service, accepting traffic on port 30001/TCP and the internal `ClusterIP` `postgres` with the port `5432` open to accept connections from you python app.
3. In a terminal, curl the service. Note that a database was not deployed in this example.
   
   ```
   $ curl http://localhost:30001/
   Hello, Docker!!!
   ```
4. Run the following commands to tear down your application.
   
   ```
   $ kubectl delete -f docker-python-kubernetes.yaml
   $ kubectl delete -f docker-postgres-kubernetes.yaml
   ```
