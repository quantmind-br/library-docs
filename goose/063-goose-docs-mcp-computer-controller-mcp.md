The Computer Controller extension helps automate everyday computer tasks and web interactions such as searching the web, controlling system settings, processing data files, and controlling applications without needing to know how to code.

This tutorial covers enabling and using the Computer Controller MCP Server, which is a built-in goose extension.

goose, I need to decompress while researching AI models for tomorrow's meeting. Can you create a relaxing environment and help me research?

1. Play classical music in Safari
2. Dim screen brightness (2 levels)
3. Research current flagship AI models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google):
    * Verify availability
    * Collect: release date, features, pricing, context window
    * Use official sources only
4. Create "ai-models-comparison.csv" on desktop with collected data
5. Launch Numbers and open the CSV file
6. Reset brightness and close Safari
