## [Component Library](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/component-library)

The Component Library is a tool designed for developers to identify frequently used user interface (UI) components and encourage their reuse within Moodle. It includes both components from Twitter Bootstrap and Moodle itself. The library provides an organized display of these components, showcasing them with your current Moodle theme.
