## [Legacy TinyMCE Editor plugins](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/plugintypes/tiny/legacy)

## [Testing](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/plugintypes/tiny/testing)

Testing is an important part of development and we strongly encourage you to write appropriate tests for your plugins.

## [TinyMCE Editor Plugins](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/plugintypes/tiny)
