Learn how to rollback your application in Dokploy.

Rollbacks are a powerful feature that allows you to easily revert changes to your application. This is particularly useful when you encounter issues or want to revert to a previous version of your application.

Dokploy supports two types of rollback mechanisms:

1. **Docker Swarm Rollbacks** (Automatic): Based on health checks, automatically reverts to the previous version if a deployment fails health checks
2. **Registry-based Rollbacks** (Manual): Uses Docker registry to store each deployment's image, allowing you to manually rollback to any specific deployment version

The rollback methods described in the first section of this guide are based on **Docker Swarm's automatic rollback feature**. Dokploy also supports **registry-based rollbacks** at the deployment level, which allows you to save each deployment's image to a registry and rollback to any specific version. See the "Rollback to a specific version" section below for more details.

1. Have a `/health` endpoint in your application.
2. Have `curl` available in your container (if you use alpine for example, it won't be installed by default).

This method uses Docker Swarm's built-in rollback feature, which automatically reverts to the previous version if health checks fail during deployment.

This rollback method is **automatic** and based on Docker Swarm's health check system. It only works if the new deployment fails health checks, triggering an automatic rollback to the previous version.

### [Steps to Configure Automatic Rollback](#steps-to-configure-automatic-rollback)

Let's suppose we have a NodeJS application that has a health check route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code and running in the port 3000.

1. In your application is necessary to have a `Path` or `Health Route` to be able to achieve zero downtime deployments eg. in the case of a NodeJS app you can have a route `/api/health` that returns a 200 status code.
2. Go to `Advanced` Tab and go to Cluster Settings and enter to `Swarm Settings`
3. There are a couple options that you can use, in this case we will focus on `Health Check` and `Update Config`.
4. Paste this code in the health check field: Make sure the API Route exists in your application

```
{
  "Test": [
    "CMD",
    "curl",
    "-f",
    "http://localhost:3000/api/health"
  ],
  "Interval": 30000000000,
  "Timeout": 10000000000,
  "StartPeriod": 30000000000,
  "Retries": 3
}
```

5. Now in the `Update Config`

Now when the application is getting unhealthy response from the health check, the container will rollback to the previous version.

Paste the following code:

```
{
  "Parallelism": 1,
  "Delay": 10000000000,
  "FailureAction": "rollback",
  "Order": "start-first"
}
```

The previous section covered Docker Swarm's automatic rollback feature, which only works when health checks fail. Dokploy also supports **registry-based rollbacks** at the deployment level, which provides more control and flexibility.

### [How Registry-based Rollbacks Work](#how-registry-based-rollbacks-work)

When using registry-based rollbacks, Dokploy:

- **Saves each deployment's image to your configured registry**: Every time you deploy, the built image is tagged and pushed to your Docker registry (Docker Hub, GHCR, etc.)
- **Associates each deployment with its image**: Each deployment record in Dokploy is linked to a specific image tag in your registry
- **Enables rollback to any deployment**: You can rollback to any previous deployment by using the image that was saved during that deployment

This approach is different from Docker Swarm rollbacks because:

- ✅ **Works with any deployment**: Not limited to health check failures
- ✅ **Rollback to any version**: Can rollback to any previous deployment, not just the immediate previous one
- ✅ **Uses registry storage**: Images are stored in your registry, making them persistent and accessible

Registry-based rollbacks require that your application is configured to use a Docker registry. The images are automatically pushed to your registry during each deployment, and Dokploy tracks which image corresponds to each deployment.

### [Prerequisites for Registry-based Rollbacks](#prerequisites-for-registry-based-rollbacks)

To use registry-based rollbacks, you need:

1. **A configured Docker registry** in Dokploy (Docker Hub, GHCR, or custom registry)
2. **Registry credentials** set up in Dokploy's registry settings
3. **Application configured to push images** to the registry during deployment

When you enable rollbacks, Dokploy will automatically push each deployment's image to your configured registry with a unique tag, allowing you to rollback to any specific deployment version.

### [Enabling Registry-based Rollbacks](#enabling-registry-based-rollbacks)

To start saving deployment images to your registry for rollbacks:

1. Navigate to your application
2. Go to **Deployments** → **Rollback Settings**
3. Enable the **Rollback** option
4. Select the registry you want to use for rollbacks
5. Click on **Save**

Once enabled, Dokploy will:

- **Automatically tag and push images**: Every deployment's image is tagged and pushed to your configured registry
- **Track deployment associations**: Each deployment is linked to its specific image tag in the registry
- **Enable rollback buttons**: You'll see a **Rollback** button next to each deployment in the Deployments section

### [Performing a Registry-based Rollback](#performing-a-registry-based-rollback)

1. Go to your application's **Deployments** section
2. Find the deployment version you want to rollback to
3. Click the **Rollback** button next to that deployment
4. Confirm the rollback action

After clicking **Rollback**, you'll need to wait a few seconds for Dokploy to download the image from your registry. The container will not appear in the **Logs** tab immediately - wait a moment for the image download to complete before checking the logs to see the container running.
