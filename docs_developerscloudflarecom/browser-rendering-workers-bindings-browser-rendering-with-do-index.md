By following this guide, you will create a Worker that uses the Browser Rendering API along with [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) to take screenshots from web pages and store them in [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/).

Using Durable Objects to persist browser sessions improves performance by eliminating the time that it takes to spin up a new browser session. Since Durable Objects re-uses sessions, it reduces the number of concurrent sessions needed.

1. Sign up for a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up/workers-and-pages).
2. Install [`Node.js`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Node.js version manager

Use a Node version manager like [Volta](https://volta.sh/) or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to avoid permission issues and change Node.js versions. [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/), discussed later in this guide, requires a Node version of `16.17.0` or later.

## 1. Create a Worker project

[Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) provides a serverless execution environment that allows you to create new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. Your Worker application is a container to interact with a headless browser to do actions, such as taking screenshots.

Create a new Worker project named `browser-worker` by running:

* npm

  ```sh
  npm create cloudflare@latest -- browser-worker
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn create cloudflare browser-worker
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm create cloudflare@latest browser-worker
  ```

## 2. Install Puppeteer

In your `browser-worker` directory, install Cloudflare’s [fork of Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/):

* npm

  ```sh
  npm i -D @cloudflare/puppeteer
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn add -D @cloudflare/puppeteer
  ```

* pnpm

  ```sh
  pnpm add -D @cloudflare/puppeteer
  ```

## 3. Create a R2 bucket

Create two R2 buckets, one for production, and one for development.

Note that bucket names must be lowercase and can only contain dashes.

```sh
wrangler r2 bucket create screenshots
wrangler r2 bucket create screenshots-test
```

To check that your buckets were created, run:

```sh
wrangler r2 bucket list
```

After running the `list` command, you will see all bucket names, including the ones you have just created.

## 4. Configure your Wrangler configuration file

Configure your `browser-worker` project's [Wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) by adding a browser [binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) and a [Node.js compatibility flag](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag). Browser bindings allow for communication between a Worker and a headless browser which allows you to do actions such as taking a screenshot, generating a PDF and more.

Update your Wrangler configuration file with the Browser Rendering API binding, the R2 bucket you created and a Durable Object:

Note

Your Worker configuration must include the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag and a `compatibility_date` of 2025-09-15 or later.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "name": "rendering-api-demo",
    "main": "src/index.js",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-09-17",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "nodejs_compat"
    ],
    "account_id": "<ACCOUNT_ID>",
    "browser": {
      "binding": "MYBROWSER"
    },
    "r2_buckets": [
      {
        "binding": "BUCKET",
        "bucket_name": "screenshots",
        "preview_bucket_name": "screenshots-test"
      }
    ],
    "durable_objects": {
      "bindings": [
        {
          "name": "BROWSER",
          "class_name": "Browser"
        }
      ]
    },
    "migrations": [
      {
        "tag": "v1",
        "new_sqlite_classes": [
          "Browser"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  name = "rendering-api-demo"
  main = "src/index.js"
  compatibility_date = "2025-09-17"
  compatibility_flags = [ "nodejs_compat"]
  account_id = "<ACCOUNT_ID>"




  # Browser Rendering API binding
  browser = { binding = "MYBROWSER" }


  # Bind an R2 Bucket
  [[r2_buckets]]
  binding = "BUCKET"
  bucket_name = "screenshots"
  preview_bucket_name = "screenshots-test"


  # Binding to a Durable Object
  [[durable_objects.bindings]]
  name = "BROWSER"
  class_name = "Browser"


  [[migrations]]
  tag = "v1" # Should be unique for each entry
  new_sqlite_classes = ["Browser"] # Array of new classes
  ```

## 5. Code

The code below uses Durable Object to instantiate a browser using Puppeteer. It then opens a series of web pages with different resolutions, takes a screenshot of each, and uploads it to R2.

The Durable Object keeps a browser session open for 60 seconds after last use. If a browser session is open, any requests will re-use the existing session rather than creating a new one. Update your Worker code by copy and pasting the following:

```js
import puppeteer from "@cloudflare/puppeteer";


export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    let obj = env.BROWSER.getByName("browser");


    // Send a request to the Durable Object, then await its response.
    let resp = await obj.fetch(request.url);


    return resp;
  },
};


const KEEP_BROWSER_ALIVE_IN_SECONDS = 60;


export class Browser {
  constructor(state, env) {
    this.state = state;
    this.env = env;
    this.keptAliveInSeconds = 0;
    this.storage = this.state.storage;
  }


  async fetch(request) {
    // screen resolutions to test out
    const width = [1920, 1366, 1536, 360, 414];
    const height = [1080, 768, 864, 640, 896];


    // use the current date and time to create a folder structure for R2
    const nowDate = new Date();
    var coeff = 1000 * 60 * 5;
    var roundedDate = new Date(
      Math.round(nowDate.getTime() / coeff) * coeff,
    ).toString();
    var folder = roundedDate.split(" GMT")[0];


    //if there's a browser session open, re-use it
    if (!this.browser || !this.browser.isConnected()) {
      console.log(`Browser DO: Starting new instance`);
      try {
        this.browser = await puppeteer.launch(this.env.MYBROWSER);
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(
          `Browser DO: Could not start browser instance. Error: ${e}`,
        );
      }
    }


    // Reset keptAlive after each call to the DO
    this.keptAliveInSeconds = 0;


    const page = await this.browser.newPage();


    // take screenshots of each screen size
    for (let i = 0; i < width.length; i++) {
      await page.setViewport({ width: width[i], height: height[i] });
      await page.goto("https://workers.cloudflare.com/");
      const fileName = "screenshot_" + width[i] + "x" + height[i];
      const sc = await page.screenshot();


      await this.env.BUCKET.put(folder + "/" + fileName + ".jpg", sc);
    }


    // Close tab when there is no more work to be done on the page
    await page.close();


    // Reset keptAlive after performing tasks to the DO.
    this.keptAliveInSeconds = 0;


    // set the first alarm to keep DO alive
    let currentAlarm = await this.storage.getAlarm();
    if (currentAlarm == null) {
      console.log(`Browser DO: setting alarm`);
      const TEN_SECONDS = 10 * 1000;
      await this.storage.setAlarm(Date.now() + TEN_SECONDS);
    }


    return new Response("success");
  }


  async alarm() {
    this.keptAliveInSeconds += 10;


    // Extend browser DO life
    if (this.keptAliveInSeconds < KEEP_BROWSER_ALIVE_IN_SECONDS) {
      console.log(
        `Browser DO: has been kept alive for ${this.keptAliveInSeconds} seconds. Extending lifespan.`,
      );
      await this.storage.setAlarm(Date.now() + 10 * 1000);
      // You could ensure the ws connection is kept alive by requesting something
      // or just let it close automatically when there  is no work to be done
      // for example, `await this.browser.version()`
    } else {
      console.log(
        `Browser DO: exceeded life of ${KEEP_BROWSER_ALIVE_IN_SECONDS}s.`,
      );
      if (this.browser) {
        console.log(`Closing browser.`);
        await this.browser.close();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 6. Test

Run `npx wrangler dev` to test your Worker locally.

Use real headless browser during local development

To interact with a real headless browser during local development, set `"remote" : true` in the Browser binding configuration. Learn more in our [remote bindings documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/development-testing/#remote-bindings).

## 7. Deploy

Run [`npx wrangler deploy`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy) to deploy your Worker to the Cloudflare global network.
