## Alerts - add / edit / delete

Allows user to configure alerts in Course Settings.

### Additional Considerations

This is an account setting that must be enabled by a Customer Success Manager. Alerts are a seldom-used feature designed to send an alert to students, teachers or admins for specific triggers (e.g., no student-teacher interaction for 7 days). They are checked every day, and notifications will be sent to the student and/or the teacher until the triggering problem is resolved.
