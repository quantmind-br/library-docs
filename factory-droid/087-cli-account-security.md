# Security

> How Factory CLI keeps your code and data secure with built-in protections and best practices.

## Security-First Design

Factory CLI (Droid) is built with security at its core. Your code stays secure through encrypted authentication, strict permissions, and enterprise-grade protections.

***

## Key Security Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Secure Authentication" icon="shield-check">
    OAuth login with encrypted token storage. Tokens auto-rotate every 30 days and are stored with OS-level file permissions.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Permission Controls" icon="user-lock">
    All risky operations require explicit approval. Configure tool permissions from allow/ask/reject per your security needs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Data Encryption" icon="lock">
    All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256 with AWS KMS). Factory never trains on your code.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Local Execution" icon="computer">
    Shell commands and file edits run locally. Only necessary context and diffs are sent to Factory's secure cloud.
  </Card>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  Always review suggested code and commands before approval. You control what Droid can access and execute.
</Warning>

### Essential Security Guidelines

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Review before approving">
    **Always verify proposed commands and file changes**, especially:

    * Commands that install packages or modify system files
    * Operations involving sensitive data or credentials
    * Network requests to external services
    * File operations outside your project directory
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use isolated environments">
    **Run Droid in containers or VMs** when working with:

    * Untrusted code repositories
    * External APIs or web services
    * Experimental or potentially risky operations
    * Shared development environments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Manage permissions carefully">
    **Configure tool permissions** to match your security requirements:

    * Set high-risk commands to "reject" by default
    * Use "ask" for medium-risk operations requiring oversight
    * Only "allow" low-risk commands you trust completely
    * Review permissions regularly with the Settings menu
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Protect sensitive data">
    **Never include secrets in prompts:**

    * Use environment variables for API keys and tokens
    * Store credentials in secure credential managers
    * Exclude sensitive files from Droid's working directory
    * Use the FACTORY\_TOKEN environment variable for CI/CD
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Built-in Protections

Factory CLI includes multiple layers of security:

* **Write access restriction**: Can only modify files in the project directory and subdirectories
* **Command approval**: Risky operations require explicit user confirmation
* **Prompt injection detection**: Analyzes requests for potentially harmful instructions
* **Network request controls**: Web-fetching tools require approval by default
* **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection attacks
* **Session isolation**: Each conversation maintains separate, secure context

## Enterprise Security

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SSO & Identity" icon="user-shield">
    SAML 2.0 / OIDC single sign-on with SCIM provisioning and role-based access controls.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Data Governance" icon="database">
    Zero data retention mode, customer-managed encryption keys (BYOK), and private cloud deployments.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Compliance" icon="certificate">
    SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant, with regular penetration testing and supply chain security.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Audit & Monitoring" icon="chart-line">
    Complete session logging, OpenTelemetry metrics, and enterprise-managed security policies.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
