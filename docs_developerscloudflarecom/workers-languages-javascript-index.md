The Workers platform is designed to be [JavaScript standards compliant](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/) and web-interoperable, and supports JavaScript standards, as defined by [TC39](https://tc39.es/) (ECMAScript). Wherever possible, it uses web platform APIs, so that code can be reused across client and server, as well as across [WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/) JavaScript runtimes.

Refer to [Runtime APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/) for more information on specific JavaScript APIs available in Workers.
