# Custom Slash Commands

> Extend the CLI with reusable Markdown prompts or executable scripts that run from the chat input.

Custom slash commands turn repeatable prompts or setup steps into `/shortcuts`. Droid scans a pair of `.factory/commands` folders, turns each file into a command, and pipes the result straight into the conversation or your terminal session.

<Note>
  **Skills are now user-invokable via slash commands.** You can create skills in `.factory/skills/` that work as both slash commands (user-invoked) and Droid-invocable capabilities. Your existing `.factory/commands/` files continue to work unchanged. For new commands, consider using [skills](/cli/configuration/skills) instead – they offer additional features like supporting files and [invocation control](/cli/configuration/skills#control-who-invokes-a-skill).

## 1 · Discovery & naming

| Scope         | Location                   | Purpose                                                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workspace** | `<repo>/.factory/commands` | Project-specific commands shared with teammates. Overrides any personal command with the same slug. |
| **Personal**  | `~/.factory/commands`      | Always scanned. Stores private or cross-project shortcuts.                                          |

* Only Markdown (`*.md`) files and files with a leading shebang (`#!`) are registered.
* Filenames are slugged (lowercase, spaces → `-`, non URL-safe characters dropped). `Code Review.mdx` becomes `/code-review`.
* Invoke commands from chat with `/command-name optional arguments`. Slash suggestions use the description pulled from the file.
* Run `/commands` to open the **Custom Commands** manager UI for browsing, reloading (`R`), or importing commands.
* Commands must live at the top level of the `commands` directory. Nested folders are ignored today.

## 2 · Markdown commands

Markdown files render into a system notification that seeds droid’s next turn. Optional YAML frontmatter controls autocomplete metadata.

```md  theme={null}
---
description: Send a code review checklist
argument-hint: <branch-name>
---

Please review `$ARGUMENTS` and summarize any merge blockers, test gaps, and risky areas.

- Highlight security or performance concerns
- Suggest follow-up tasks with owners
- List files that need attention
```

| Frontmatter key | Purpose                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`   | Overrides the generated summary shown in slash suggestions.      |
| `argument-hint` | Appends inline usage hints (e.g., `/code-review <branch-name>`). |
| `allowed-tools` | Reserved for future use. Safe to omit.                           |

`$ARGUMENTS` expands to everything typed after the command name. If you do not reference `$ARGUMENTS`, the body is sent unchanged.

<Tip>
  Markdown output is wrapped in a system notification so the next agent turn
  immediately sees the prompt.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Positional placeholders like `$1` or `$2` are not supported yet—use
  `$ARGUMENTS` and parse inside the prompt if you need structured input.
</Note>

## 3 · Executable commands

Executable files must start with a valid shebang so the CLI can call the interpreter.

```bash  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "Preparing $1"
npm install
npm run lint
echo "Ready to deploy $1"
```

* The executable receives the command arguments (`/deploy feature/login` → `$1=feature/login`).
* Scripts run from the current working directory and inherit your environment, so they have the same permissions you do.
* Stdout and stderr (up to 64 KB) plus the script contents are posted back to the chat transcript for transparency. Failures still surface their logs.

***

## 4 · Managing commands

* **Edit or add** files directly in `.factory/commands`. The CLI rescans on launch; press `R` inside `/commands` to reload without restarting.
* **Import** existing `.agents` or `.claude` commands: open `/commands`, press `I`, select entries, and they copy into your Factory directory.
* **Remove** a command by deleting its file. Since workspace commands win precedence, deleting the repo version reveals the personal fallback if one exists.

***

## 5 · Usage patterns

* Keep project workflows under version control inside the repo’s `.factory/commands` so teammates share the same shortcuts.
* Build idempotent scripts that are safe to rerun; document any cleanup steps in the file itself.
* Use Markdown templates for checklists, code review rubrics, onboarding instructions, or context packets you frequently provide to droid.
* Review executable commands like any other source code—treat secrets carefully and prefer referencing environment variables already loaded in your shell.

## 6 · Examples

### Code review rubric (Markdown)

```md  theme={null}
---
description: Ask droid for a structured code review
argument-hint: <branch-or-PR>
---

Review `$ARGUMENTS` and respond with:

1. **Summary** – What changed and why it matters.
2. **Correctness** – Tests, edge cases, and regressions to check.
3. **Risks** – Security, performance, or migration concerns.
4. **Follow-up** – Concrete TODOs for the author.

Include file paths alongside any specific feedback.
```

Invoke with `/review feature/login-flow` to seed droid with a consistent checklist before it inspects the diff.

### Daily standup helper (Markdown)

```md  theme={null}
---
description: Summarize progress for standup
---

Draft a standup update using:

- **Yesterday:** Key wins, merged PRs, or blockers cleared.
- **Today:** Planned work items and their goals.
- **Risks:** Anything at risk of slipping, support needed, or cross-team dependencies.

Keep it to three short bullet sections.
```

Use `/standup` after droid reviews your git history or TODO list to generate a polished update.

### Regression smoke test (Executable)

```bash  theme={null}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

target=${1:-"src"}

echo "Running lint + unit tests for $target"
npm run lint -- "$target"
npm test -- --runTestsByPath "$target"

echo "Collecting git status"
git status --short

echo "Done"
```

Saved as `smoke.sh`, this shows up as `/smoke`. Pass a path (`/smoke src/widgets/__tests__/widget.test.tsx`) to constrain the checks and share the aggregated output with everyone on the thread.

Once set up, custom slash commands compress multi-step prompts or environment setup into a single keystroke, keeping your focus on guiding droid instead of repeating boilerplate.
