The Edit option provides you available options to modify a specific image. After choosing to edit an image, you can:

* Require signed URLs to use with that particular image.
* Use a cURL command you can use as an example to access the image.
* Use fully-formed URLs for all the variants configured in your account.

To edit an image:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the **Transformations** page.

   [Go to **Transformations**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/images/transformations)

2. Locate the image you want to modify and select **Edit**.
