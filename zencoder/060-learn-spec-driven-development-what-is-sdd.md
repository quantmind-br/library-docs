Spec-Driven Development (SDD) is the opposite of vibe-coding. Instead of sending an AI agent on a scavenger hunt, you hand it a crystal-clear blueprint so the work lands right on the first pass. You treat the agent like a literal-minded teammate: the more detail you prep in advance, the less you have to bounce back and forth fixing guesses.

## Why spec first?

## How it differs from traditional prompting

## The mini SDD loop

## A loose outline you can borrow

## When to reach for SDD

- Legacy or regulated repos where surprises are expensive
- Multi-system changes that span backend, frontend, and infra
- Work that depends on existing patterns (naming, testing, telemetry)
- Anytime “just wing it” would cause rework or risk

Think of SDD as storyboarding a movie scene before the cameras roll. The prep feels slower, but the actual shoot (and edit) goes way faster—especially when your co-star is an AI agent that thrives on precise direction.
