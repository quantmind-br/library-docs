## Users - generate observer pairing codes for students

Allows user to generate a pairing code on behalf of a student to share with an observer.

### Additional Considerations

To generate a pairing code from a student\`s User Settings page, the User - act as permission must also be enabled.

To generate a pairing code from a student\`s User Details page, the Users - allow administrative actions in courses permission must also be enabled.

Pairing codes are only supported when self registration is enabled for the account.

QR codes are not the same as pairing codes and are only used to help users log into their own accounts via the Canvas mobile apps. To disable QR code logins for all users in your account, please contact your Customer Success Manager.
