## Ghostty 1.2.3

Release notes for Ghostty 1.2.3, released on October 23, 2025.

Ghostty 1.2.3 features **two weeks of work** with changes from **6 contributors** over **27 commits.** This is a patch release primarily focused on fixing issues introduced in the 1.2.x series.

> This release contains a critical fix for a deadlock scenario that can happen on all platforms. We highly recommend that all users on prior 1.2.x versions upgrade to this version at their soonest convenience.

PRs: [#9090](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9090) [#9163](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9163) [#9168](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9168) [#1787](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/1787) [#1813](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/1813) [#1945](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/1945) [#8612](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8612)

Ghostty 1.2.3 includes multiple fixes for `macos-titlebar-style = tabs`, including many issues that have existed since pre-1.0! Additionally, multiple Tahoe-specific (macOS 26) bugs related to this configuration were also fixed, since Tahoe introduced a dramatically different tab bar.

An overview of the changes:

- Fixed title misalignment and clipping in tab titlebar style.
- Corrected titlebar coloring in fullscreen mode when titlebar tabs are enabled.
- Resolved issues where theme changes would cause the titlebar to lose styling.
- Fixed truncated title appearing in top-left corner when using tab titlebar style in fullscreen.
- Improved behavior with macOS 26 native fullscreen and titlebar tabs.

PRs: [#9142](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9142) [#9152](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9152) [#9160](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9160)

Ghostty 1.2.3 continues to include a number of refinements to the rewritten font rendering system introduced in 1.2.0. The changes in Ghostty 1.2.3 focus primarily on icon glyphs (e.g. Nerd Fonts). Ghostty 1.2.3 users should see better sized icons in all scenarios.

This addresses all currently known font *rendering* issues, particularly those stemming from the rewritten renderer in 1.2.0. Note that there are still other known font-related issues but they either predate Ghostty 1.2 or are otherwise unrelated to font rendering (and are instead related to font discovery, loading, shaping, etc.).

In each section, we try to sort improvements before bug fixes.

- font: Numerous tweaks to improve various edge cases, especially around icon glyphs. [#9076](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9076) [#9142](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9142) [#9160](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9160) [#9152](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9152)
- terminal: add semi-colon character to word boundary list for selection. [#9069](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9069)
- input: modify other keys 2 should use all mods, ignore consumed mods. This fixes a misencoding that caused shifted modifiers to not work with tmux (but also any other terminal program using modify other keys state 2) [#9289](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9289)
- Fix a deadlock scenario where programs that emit many color change or query operations could cause Ghostty to hang. [#9224](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9224)
- Fix a resource leak by not starting the scroll timer when scrolling outside the viewport if the scroll timer is already active. [#9195](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9195)
- Fix memory corruption that could happen when starting a scroll in one screen (primary vs alt) and continuing to scroll after the terminal program switched screens. [#9223](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9223)
- renderer: fix garbled rendering under some cases. [#9252](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9252)
- shell-integration: `ssh-terminfo` now caches properly for IPv6 addresses. [#9251](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9251) [#9281](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9281)
- shell-integration: cursor integration now works in vi mode for fish. [#9157](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9157)
- shell-integration: no longer updates universal `fish_user_paths` variable. [#9273](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9273)

<!--THE END-->

- macOS: Quick terminal size is now properly remembered per screen. [#9256](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9256)
- macOS: `goto_split` direction is now compatible with `performable:` bindings. [#9283](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9283) [#9284](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9284)
- macOS: `window-position-x/y` works properly paired with `window-width/height`. [#9313](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9313)
- macOS: Fix UI hang when pasting large unsafe text. [#9322](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9322) [#9324](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9324)
- macOS: Fixed multiple `macos-titlebar-style=tabs` related issues. [#1787](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/1787) [#1813](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/1813) [#1945](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/1945) [#8612](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8612) [#9090](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9090) [#9163](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9163)
- macOS: New Tab action now reliably opens tab instead of window when appropriate. [#9124](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9124)
- macOS: Fix crash if Cocoa APIs return a nil locale. [#9290](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9290)

<!--THE END-->

- GTK: If `title` is configured, set the correct window title immediately. [#9120](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9120)
- GTK: quick terminal autohide now works properly. [#9145](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9145) [#9139](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9139)

<!--THE END-->

- A new `-Demit-themes` (default true) build option has been added to build Ghostty without any bundled themes. This was added for packagers who are sensitive to licensing issues that may exist in our upstream dependency. We're looking into this in more detail but this is meant as a short-term solution to avoid the themes entirely if there are concerns. [#9288](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9288)

We don't plan on releasing any further 1.2.x releases, except in the circumstance that a critical issue is found. The 1.2.x series has already been very stable, and we believe 1.2.3 addresses the remaining major issues that exist.

That doesn't mean Ghostty is without bugs, of course! We'll continue to fix bugs and improve features, but unless those bugs are critical, we'll hold their release until Ghostty 1.3.0.
