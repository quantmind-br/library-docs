## [AJAX](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/guides/javascript/ajax)

The preferred way to write new ajax interactions in Moodle is to use the JavaScript module core/ajax which directly calls web service functions built using the Moodle Web Service API.

## [Modules](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/guides/javascript/modules)

A JavaScript module is a package of code that can be reliably used and shared with other code in a reusable format.

## [Templates](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/guides/templates)

A guide to the features and use of Mustache templating in Moodle.

## [YUI](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/guides/javascript/yui)

As of Moodle 2.9 we are transitioning away from YUI to AMD modules. This transition will take a long time, but it is important because the YUI team have stopped all new development on the YUI library. See JavaScript Modules for more information.
