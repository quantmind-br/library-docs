## Manage a Docker account

Table of contents

* * *

You can centrally manage your Docker account using Docker Home, including adminstrative and security settings.

> Tip
> 
> If your account is associated with an organization that enforces single sign-on (SSO), you may not have permissions to update your account settings. You must contact your administrator to update your settings.

## [Update account information](#update-account-information)

Account information is visible on your **Account settings** page. You can update the following account information:

- Full name
- Company
- Location
- Website
- Gravatar email

To add or update your avatar using Gravatar:

1. Create a [Gravatar account](https://gravatar.com/).
2. Create your avatar.
3. Add your Gravatar email to your Docker account settings.

It may take some time for your avatar to update in Docker.

## [Update email address](#update-email-address)

To update your email address:

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).
2. Select your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Account settings**.
3. Select **Email**.
4. Enter your new email address and your password to confirm the change.
5. Select **Send verification email**. Docker sends a verification link to your new email.

Your new email address will appear as unverified until you complete the verification process. You can:

- Resend the verification email if needed.
- Remove the unverified email address at any time before verification.

To verify your email, open your email client and follow the instructions in the Docker verification email.

> Note
> 
> Docker accounts only support one verified email address at a time, which is used for account notifications and security-related communications. You can't add multiple verified email addresses to your account.

## [Change your password](#change-your-password)

You can change your password by initiating a password reset via email. To change your password:

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).
2. Select your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Account settings**.
3. Select **Password**, then **Reset password**.
4. Docker will send you a password reset email with instructions to reset your password.

## [Manage two-factor authentication](#manage-two-factor-authentication)

To update your two-factor authentication (2FA) settings:

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).
2. Select your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Account settings**.
3. Select **2FA**.

For more information, see [Enable two-factor authentication](https://docs.docker.com/security/2fa/).

## [Manage personal access tokens](#manage-personal-access-tokens)

To manage personal access tokens:

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).
2. Select your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Account settings**.
3. Select **Personal access tokens**.

For more information, see [Create and manage access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/security/access-tokens/).

## [Manage connected accounts](#manage-connected-accounts)

2. Select your avatar in the top-right corner and select **Account settings**.
3. Select **Connected accounts**.
4. Select **Disconnect** on your connected account.

To fully unlink your Docker account, you must also unlink Docker from Google or GitHub. See Google or GitHub's documentation for more information:
