## [Acceptance testing for the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/testing/acceptance-testing)

In order to run tests that carry out automated functionality testing for the Moodle App, you can write Acceptance tests. This can be useful if you want to test plugins that are compatible with the app, or you're contributing to the app core. Behat tests for the app work the same way as tests for Moodle core, but they are not run as part of a normal Behat execution and there are some differences that we'll go through in this page.

## [Applying accessibility on the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/accessibility)

Screen readers

## [Continuous Integration for the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/testing/continuous-integration)

Tests can be useful during development, but a good test suite really shines with CI processes in place. Running tests and other checks on a regular basis can be helpful to maintain good quality assurance, and catch regressions as early as possible.

## [Course Formats](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/course-formats)

You can implement custom course formats using the CoreCourseFormatDelegate:

## [Course Modules](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/course-modules)

You can implement custom course modules using the CoreCourseModuleDelegate.

## [Custom Moodle Apps](https://moodledev.io/general/app/customisation/custom-apps)

Unfortunately, the core team does not have the resources to help people use the open source code to build custom apps.

## [Debugging network requests in the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/network-debug)

Introduction

## [Forms](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/forms)

In this example, we are going to see how to display a form and send the data to a Web Service when it's submitted.

## [Groups Selector](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/groups-selector)

If you have an activity that uses groups, you may want to implement a group selector to filter the rendered content. There are many ways to achieve this, and we're going to outline some of them in this example.

## [Link Handlers](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/link-handlers)

You can create a link handler to intercept what happens when links are clicked using the CoreContentLinksDelegate.

## [Links in the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/link-handling/app-links)

Pressing a link inside the app

The development of new features and improvements in the Moodle App is organised in the following six phases:

## [Moodle App Overview](https://moodledev.io/general/app/overview)

The Moodle App is a mobile application that helps users make the best of their Moodle sites on handheld devices. It has some additional features like offline access, and a dedicated interface adapted to mobile. It's focused on student functionality, so you won't find all the features you have on the web for teachers and admins. You can learn more about the features available in the user documentation.

## [Prefetch Handlers](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/prefetch-handlers)

CoreCourseModuleDelegate handlers allow you to define a list of offline functions to prefetch a module. However, you might want to create your own prefetch handler to determine what needs to be downloaded. For example, you might need to chain Web Service calls (passing the result of a Web Service request to another), and this cannot be done using offline functions.

## [Question Types](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/question-types)

You can implement custom question types using the CoreQuestionDelegate:

## [Self Enrolment](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/examples/self-enrolment)

Using CoreEnrolDelegate handlers you can support enrolment plugins in the app. In this example, we can see how to support a self enrol plugin. You'll need to register a handler in db/mobile.php and return the following JavaScript from the method implementation:

## [Sending custom Push Notifications to the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/custom-push-notifications)

There are two ways to send custom Push Notifications to the Moodle app users:

## [Setting up your development environment for the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/setup)

The structure of this page is the following:

## [Testing LMS issues in the mobile app](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/testing/testing-lms-app)

Information related to mobile app testing of LMS issues

## [Troubleshooting Moodle App Plugins Development](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide/troubleshooting)

Plugin changes are not picked up in the app

## [Troubleshooting when setting up your development environment for the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/setup/troubleshooting)

This page contains a list of common errors that have been found and how to solve them. However, keep in mind that these may be platform-dependent and could not fix the problem in your machine, even if you are seeing the same error message.

## [Unit testing for the Moodle App](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/testing/unit-testing)

Unit tests are written in JavaScript using Jest. If you want to create a new one, Jest is already configured and you only need to create a file ending with .test.ts within the project. If you're going to do so, remember to follow the file location conventions.

## [Using the Moodle App in a browser](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/setup/app-in-browser)

Browsers are not officially supported by the application in production, but you can use a Chromium-based browser for development if you don't need any native functionality.
