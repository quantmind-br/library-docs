info

The following is the complete skill definition that Hermes loads when this skill is triggered. This is what the agent sees as instructions when the skill is active.

## Base Blockchain Skill

Query Base (Ethereum L2) on-chain data enriched with USD pricing via CoinGecko. 8 commands: wallet portfolio, token info, transactions, gas analysis, contract inspection, whale detection, network stats, and price lookup.

No API key needed. Uses only Python standard library (urllib, json, argparse).

* * *

## When to Use[​](#when-to-use "Direct link to When to Use")

- User asks for a Base wallet balance, token holdings, or portfolio value
- User wants to inspect a specific transaction by hash
- User wants ERC-20 token metadata, price, supply, or market cap
- User wants to understand Base gas costs and L1 data fees
- User wants to inspect a contract (ERC type detection, proxy resolution)
- User wants to find large ETH transfers (whale detection)
- User wants Base network health, gas price, or ETH price
- User asks "what's the price of USDC/AERO/DEGEN/ETH?"

* * *

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

The helper script uses only Python standard library (urllib, json, argparse). No external packages required.

Pricing data comes from CoinGecko's free API (no key needed, rate-limited to ~10-30 requests/minute). For faster lookups, use `--no-prices` flag.

## Quick Reference[​](#quick-reference "Direct link to Quick Reference")

RPC endpoint (default): [https://mainnet.base.org](https://mainnet.base.org) Override: export BASE\_RPC\_URL=[https://your-private-rpc.com](https://your-private-rpc.com)

Helper script path: ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base\_client.py

```text
python3 base_client.py wallet   <address> [--limit N] [--all] [--no-prices]
python3 base_client.py tx       <hash>
python3 base_client.py token    <contract_address>
python3 base_client.py gas
python3 base_client.py contract <address>
python3 base_client.py whales   [--min-eth N]
python3 base_client.py stats
python3 base_client.py price    <contract_address_or_symbol>
```

## Procedure[​](#procedure "Direct link to Procedure")

### 0. Setup Check[​](#0-setup-check "Direct link to 0. Setup Check")

```bash
python3 --version

# Optional: set a private RPC for better rate limits
exportBASE_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.base.org"

# Confirm connectivity
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py stats
```

### 1. Wallet Portfolio[​](#1-wallet-portfolio "Direct link to 1. Wallet Portfolio")

Get ETH balance and ERC-20 token holdings with USD values. Checks ~15 well-known Base tokens (USDC, WETH, AERO, DEGEN, etc.) via on-chain `balanceOf` calls. Tokens sorted by value, dust filtered.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py \
  wallet 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```

Flags:

- `--limit N` — show top N tokens (default: 20)
- `--all` — show all tokens, no dust filter, no limit
- `--no-prices` — skip CoinGecko price lookups (faster, RPC-only)

Output includes: ETH balance + USD value, token list with prices sorted by value, dust count, total portfolio value in USD.

Note: Only checks known tokens. Unknown ERC-20s are not discovered. Use the `token` command with a specific contract address for any token.

### 2. Transaction Details[​](#2-transaction-details "Direct link to 2. Transaction Details")

Inspect a full transaction by its hash. Shows ETH value transferred, gas used, fee in ETH/USD, status, and decoded ERC-20/ERC-721 transfers.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py \
  tx 0xabc123...your_tx_hash_here
```

Output: hash, block, from, to, value (ETH + USD), gas price, gas used, fee, status, contract creation address (if any), token transfers.

### 3. Token Info[​](#3-token-info "Direct link to 3. Token Info")

Get ERC-20 token metadata: name, symbol, decimals, total supply, price, market cap, and contract code size.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py \
  token 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
```

Output: name, symbol, decimals, total supply, price, market cap. Reads name/symbol/decimals directly from the contract via eth\_call.

### 4. Gas Analysis[​](#4-gas-analysis "Direct link to 4. Gas Analysis")

Detailed gas analysis with cost estimates for common operations. Shows current gas price, base fee trends over 10 blocks, block utilization, and estimated costs for ETH transfers, ERC-20 transfers, and swaps.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py gas
```

Output: current gas price, base fee, block utilization, 10-block trend, cost estimates in ETH and USD.

Note: Base is an L2 — actual transaction costs include an L1 data posting fee that depends on calldata size and L1 gas prices. The estimates shown are for L2 execution only.

### 5. Contract Inspection[​](#5-contract-inspection "Direct link to 5. Contract Inspection")

Inspect an address: determine if it's an EOA or contract, detect ERC-20/ERC-721/ERC-1155 interfaces, resolve EIP-1967 proxy implementation addresses.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py \
  contract 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
```

Output: is\_contract, code size, ETH balance, detected interfaces (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155), ERC-20 metadata, proxy implementation address.

### 6. Whale Detector[​](#6-whale-detector "Direct link to 6. Whale Detector")

Scan the most recent block for large ETH transfers with USD values.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py \
  whales --min-eth 1.0
```

Note: scans the latest block only — point-in-time snapshot, not historical. Default threshold is 1.0 ETH (lower than Solana's default since ETH values are higher).

### 7. Network Stats[​](#7-network-stats "Direct link to 7. Network Stats")

Live Base network health: latest block, chain ID, gas price, base fee, block utilization, transaction count, and ETH price.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py stats
```

### 8. Price Lookup[​](#8-price-lookup "Direct link to 8. Price Lookup")

Quick price check for any token by contract address or known symbol.

```bash
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py price ETH
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py price USDC
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py price AERO
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py price DEGEN
python3 ~/.hermes/skills/blockchain/base/scripts/base_client.py price 0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913
```

Known symbols: ETH, WETH, USDC, cbETH, AERO, DEGEN, TOSHI, BRETT, WELL, wstETH, rETH, cbBTC.

## Pitfalls[​](#pitfalls "Direct link to Pitfalls")

- **CoinGecko rate-limits** — free tier allows ~10-30 requests/minute. Price lookups use 1 request per token. Use `--no-prices` for speed.
- **Public RPC rate-limits** — Base's public RPC limits requests. For production use, set BASE\_RPC\_URL to a private endpoint (Alchemy, QuickNode, Infura).
- **Wallet shows known tokens only** — unlike Solana, EVM chains have no built-in "get all tokens" RPC. The wallet command checks ~15 popular Base tokens via `balanceOf`. Unknown ERC-20s won't appear. Use the `token` command for any specific contract.
- **Token names read from contract** — if a contract doesn't implement `name()` or `symbol()`, these fields may be empty. Known tokens have hardcoded labels as fallback.
- **Gas estimates are L2 only** — Base transaction costs include an L1 data posting fee (depends on calldata size and L1 gas prices). The gas command estimates L2 execution cost only.
- **Whale detector scans latest block only** — not historical. Results vary by the moment you query. Default threshold is 1.0 ETH.
- **Proxy detection** — only EIP-1967 proxies are detected. Other proxy patterns (EIP-1167 minimal proxy, custom storage slots) are not checked.
- **Retry on 429** — both RPC and CoinGecko calls retry up to 2 times with exponential backoff on rate-limit errors.
