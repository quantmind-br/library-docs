## Building Memory-Enabled Agents with DSPy ReAct and Mem0[¶](#building-memory-enabled-agents-with-dspy-react-and-mem0 "Permanent link")

This tutorial demonstrates how to build intelligent conversational agents that can remember information across interactions using DSPy's ReAct framework combined with [Mem0](https://docs.mem0.ai/)'s memory capabilities. You'll learn to create agents that can store, retrieve, and use contextual information to provide personalized and coherent responses.

## What You'll Build[¶](#what-youll-build "Permanent link")

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a memory-enabled agent that can:

- **Remember user preferences** and past conversations
- **Store and retrieve factual information** about users and topics
- **Use memory to inform decisions** and provide personalized responses
- **Handle complex multi-turn conversations** with context awareness
- **Manage different types of memories** (facts, preferences, experiences)

## Prerequisites[¶](#prerequisites "Permanent link")

- Basic understanding of DSPy and ReAct agents
- Python 3.9+ installed
- API keys for your preferred LLM provider

## Installation and Setup[¶](#installation-and-setup "Permanent link")

## Step 1: Understanding Mem0 Integration[¶](#step-1-understanding-mem0-integration "Permanent link")

Mem0 provides a memory layer that can store, search, and retrieve memories for AI agents. Let's start by understanding how to integrate it with DSPy:

```
importdspy
frommem0import Memory
importos
fromtypingimport List, Dict, Any, Optional
fromdatetimeimport datetime

# Configure environment
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-openai-api-key"

# Initialize Mem0 memory system
config = {
    "llm": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
            "temperature": 0.1
        }
    },
    "embedder": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "config": {
            "model": "text-embedding-3-small"
        }
    }
}
```

Let's create tools that can interact with the memory system:

```
importdatetime

classMemoryTools:
"""Tools for interacting with the Mem0 memory system."""

    def__init__(self, memory: Memory):
        self.memory = memory

    defstore_memory(self, content: str, user_id: str = "default_user") -> str:
"""Store information in memory."""
        try:
            self.memory.add(content, user_id=user_id)
            return f"Stored memory: {content}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error storing memory: {str(e)}"

    defsearch_memories(self, query: str, user_id: str = "default_user", limit: int = 5) -> str:
"""Search for relevant memories."""
        try:
            results = self.memory.search(query, user_id=user_id, limit=limit)
            if not results:
                return "No relevant memories found."

            memory_text = "Relevant memories found:\n"
            for i, result in enumerate(results["results"]):
                memory_text += f"{i}. {result['memory']}\n"
            return memory_text
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error searching memories: {str(e)}"

    defget_all_memories(self, user_id: str = "default_user") -> str:
"""Get all memories for a user."""
        try:
            results = self.memory.get_all(user_id=user_id)
            if not results:
                return "No memories found for this user."

            memory_text = "All memories for user:\n"
            for i, result in enumerate(results["results"]):
                memory_text += f"{i}. {result['memory']}\n"
            return memory_text
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error retrieving memories: {str(e)}"

    defupdate_memory(self, memory_id: str, new_content: str) -> str:
"""Update an existing memory."""
        try:
            self.memory.update(memory_id, new_content)
            return f"Updated memory with new content: {new_content}"
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error updating memory: {str(e)}"

    defdelete_memory(self, memory_id: str) -> str:
"""Delete a specific memory."""
        try:
            self.memory.delete(memory_id)
            return "Memory deleted successfully."
        except Exception as e:
            return f"Error deleting memory: {str(e)}"

defget_current_time() -> str:
"""Get the current date and time."""
    return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
```

## Step 3: Build the Memory-Enhanced ReAct Agent[¶](#step-3-build-the-memory-enhanced-react-agent "Permanent link")

Now let's create our main ReAct agent that can use memory:

```
classMemoryQA(dspy.Signature):
"""
    You're a helpful assistant and have access to memory method.
    Whenever you answer a user's input, remember to store the information in memory
    so that you can use it later.
    """
    user_input: str = dspy.InputField()
    response: str = dspy.OutputField()

classMemoryReActAgent(dspy.Module):
"""A ReAct agent enhanced with Mem0 memory capabilities."""

    def__init__(self, memory: Memory):
        super().__init__()
        self.memory_tools = MemoryTools(memory)

        # Create tools list for ReAct
        self.tools = [
            self.memory_tools.store_memory,
            self.memory_tools.search_memories,
            self.memory_tools.get_all_memories,
            get_current_time,
            self.set_reminder,
            self.get_preferences,
            self.update_preferences,
        ]

        # Initialize ReAct with our tools
        self.react = dspy.ReAct(
            signature=MemoryQA,
            tools=self.tools,
            max_iters=6
        )

    defforward(self, user_input: str):
"""Process user input with memory-aware reasoning."""

        return self.react(user_input=user_input)

    defset_reminder(self, reminder_text: str, date_time: str = None, user_id: str = "default_user") -> str:
"""Set a reminder for the user."""
        reminder = f"Reminder set for {date_time}: {reminder_text}"
        return self.memory_tools.store_memory(
            f"REMINDER: {reminder}", 
            user_id=user_id
        )

    defget_preferences(self, category: str = "general", user_id: str = "default_user") -> str:
"""Get user preferences for a specific category."""
        query = f"user preferences {category}"
        return self.memory_tools.search_memories(
            query=query,
            user_id=user_id
        )

    defupdate_preferences(self, category: str, preference: str, user_id: str = "default_user") -> str:
"""Update user preferences."""
        preference_text = f"User preference for {category}: {preference}"
        return self.memory_tools.store_memory(
            preference_text,
            user_id=user_id
        )
```

## Step 4: Running the Memory-Enhanced Agent[¶](#step-4-running-the-memory-enhanced-agent "Permanent link")

Let's create a simple interface to interact with our memory-enabled agent:

```
importtime
defrun_memory_agent_demo():
"""Demonstration of memory-enhanced ReAct agent."""

    # Configure DSPy
    lm = dspy.LM(model='openai/gpt-4o-mini')
    dspy.configure(lm=lm)

    # Initialize memory system
    memory = Memory.from_config(config)

    # Create our agent
    agent = MemoryReActAgent(memory)

    # Sample conversation demonstrating memory capabilities
    print("🧠 Memory-Enhanced ReAct Agent Demo")
    print("=" * 50)

    conversations = [
        "Hi, I'm Alice and I love Italian food, especially pasta carbonara.",
        "I'm Alice. I prefer to exercise in the morning around 7 AM.",
        "I'm Alice. What do you remember about my food preferences?",
        "I'm Alice. Set a reminder for me to go grocery shopping tomorrow.",
        "I'm Alice. What are my exercise preferences?",
        "I'm Alice. I also enjoy hiking on weekends.",
        "I'm Alice. What do you know about me so far?"
    ]

    for i, user_input in enumerate(conversations, 1):
        print(f"\n📝 User: {user_input}")

        try:
            response = agent(user_input=user_input)
            print(f"🤖 Agent: {response.response}")
            time.sleep(1)

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"❌ Error: {e}")

# Run the demonstration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_memory_agent_demo()
```
