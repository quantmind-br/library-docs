## Scrape and extract structured data with Firecrawl

Firecrawl uses AI to get structured data from web pages in 3 steps:

1. **Set the Schema (optional):** Define a JSON schema (using OpenAI’s format) to specify the data you want, or just provide a `prompt` if you don’t need a strict schema, along with the webpage URL.
2. **Make the Request:** Send your URL and schema to our scrape endpoint using JSON mode. See how here: [Scrape Endpoint Documentation](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/api-reference/endpoint/scrape)
3. **Get Your Data:** Get back clean, structured data matching your schema that you can use right away.

This makes getting web data in the format you need quick and easy.

### JSON mode via /scrape

Used to extract structured data from scraped pages.

Output:

```
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "json": {
        "company_mission": "AI-powered web scraping and data extraction",
        "supports_sso": true,
        "is_open_source": true,
        "is_in_yc": true
      },
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Firecrawl",
        "description": "AI-powered web scraping and data extraction",
        "robots": "follow, index",
        "ogTitle": "Firecrawl",
        "ogDescription": "AI-powered web scraping and data extraction",
        "ogUrl": "https://firecrawl.dev/",
        "ogImage": "https://firecrawl.dev/og.png",
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
        "ogSiteName": "Firecrawl",
        "sourceURL": "https://firecrawl.dev/"
      },
    }
}
```

### Structured data without schema

You can also extract without a schema by just passing a `prompt` to the endpoint. The llm chooses the structure of the data.

Output:

```
{
    "success": true,
    "data": {
      "json": {
        "company_mission": "AI-powered web scraping and data extraction",
      },
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Firecrawl",
        "description": "AI-powered web scraping and data extraction",
        "robots": "follow, index",
        "ogTitle": "Firecrawl",
        "ogDescription": "AI-powered web scraping and data extraction",
        "ogUrl": "https://firecrawl.dev/",
        "ogImage": "https://firecrawl.dev/og.png",
        "ogLocaleAlternate": [],
        "ogSiteName": "Firecrawl",
        "sourceURL": "https://firecrawl.dev/"
      },
    }
}
```

Here’s a comprehensive example extracting structured company information from a website:

Output:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "json": {
      "company_mission": "Turn websites into LLM-ready data",
      "supports_sso": true,
      "is_open_source": true,
      "is_in_yc": true
    }
  }
}
```

### JSON format options

When using JSON mode in v2, include an object in `formats` with the schema embedded directly: `formats: [{ type: 'json', schema: { ... }, prompt: '...' }]` Parameters:

- `schema`: JSON Schema describing the structured output you want (required for schema-based extraction).
- `prompt`: Optional prompt to guide extraction (also used for no-schema extraction).

**Important:** Unlike v1, there is no separate `jsonOptions` parameter in v2. The schema must be included directly inside the format object in the `formats` array.

If you are seeing inconsistent or incomplete results from JSON extraction, these practices can help:

- **Keep prompts short and focused.** Long prompts with many rules increase variability. Move specific constraints (like allowed values) into the schema instead.
- **Use concise property names.** Avoid embedding instructions or enum lists in property names. Use a short key like `"installation_type"` and put allowed values in an `enum` array.
- **Add `enum` arrays for constrained fields.** When a field has a fixed set of values, list them in `enum` and make sure they match the exact text shown on the page.
- **Include null-handling in field descriptions.** Add `"Return null if not found on the page."` to each field’s `description` so the model does not guess missing values.
- **Add location hints.** Tell the model where to find data on the page, e.g. `"Flow rate in GPM from the Specifications table."`.
- **Split large schemas into smaller requests.** Schemas with many fields (e.g. 30+) produce less consistent results. Split them into 2–3 requests of 10–15 fields each.

**Example of a well-structured schema:**

```
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "product_name": {
      "type": ["string", "null"],
      "description": "Full descriptive product name as shown on the page. Return null if not found."
    },
    "installation_type": {
      "type": ["string", "null"],
      "description": "Installation type from the Specifications section. Return null if not found.",
      "enum": ["Deck-mount", "Wall-mount", "Countertop", "Drop-in", "Undermount"]
    },
    "flow_rate_gpm": {
      "type": ["string", "null"],
      "description": "Flow rate in GPM from the Specifications section. Return null if not found."
    }
  }
}
```
