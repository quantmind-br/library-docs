Zencoder Enterprise Best Practices distill what high-performing engineering orgs do to safely adopt AI coding, automate delivery, and prove value back to the business. Use this overview to jump into the playbooks that match your current priorities.

## Practice Areas

[**AI Coding Foundations**  
\
Explain the mechanics of LLM copilots, reduce hallucinations, and anchor teams on mental models that keep agents productive and safe.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/enterprise-best-practices/ai-coding-foundations)

[**Security, Compliance & Deployment**  
\
Learn how Zencoder meets SOC 2/ISO requirements, configure SSO + RBAC, and monitor usage with BYOK controls for regulated environments.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/enterprise-best-practices/enterprise-security-compliance-deployment)

[**Team Collaboration & Zen Agents**  
\
