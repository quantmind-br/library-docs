Welcome to the Moodle App developer documentation!

Here, you will find everything you need to start working with the Moodle App right away.

We suggest that you read the [Moodle App Overview](https://moodledev.io/general/app/overview) before diving into specifics. Once you're familiar with the basic concepts and understand how the application works, you can dig into the particulars:

- Do you want to contribute to the core? Read the [Moodle App Development Guide](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/development-guide).
- Do you want to adapt a plugin to mobile? Read the [Moodle App Plugins Development Guide](https://moodledev.io/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide).
- Do you want to customise your site in the app? Read the [Moodle App Customisation](https://moodledev.io/general/app/customisation) page.
- Do you want to make a custom app? Read the [Custom Moodle Apps](https://moodledev.io/general/app/customisation/custom-apps) page.
