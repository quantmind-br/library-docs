## [Availability API](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/subsystems/availability)

The availability API controls access to activities and sections. For example, a teacher could restrict access so that an activity cannot be accessed until a certain date, or so that a section cannot be accessed unless users have a certain grade in a quiz.

## [Availability conditions](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/plugintypes/availability)

Availability conditions allow teachers to restrict an activity or section so that only certain users can access it. These are accessed using the Availability API.
