S3 Destinations

Configure Google Cloud Storage buckets for backup storage. This includes setting up access keys, secret keys, bucket names, regions, and endpoints.

Google Cloud Storage provides a simple and cost-effective way to store and retrieve data. It is a cloud-based service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere in the world. This is a great option for storing backups, as it is easy to set up and manage.

1. Navigate to the Cloud Storage console and create a new bucket with preferred name.
2. Navigate to the IAM & Admin and create a new service account. Assign a role `Storage Admin` to the service account.
3. Return to Cloud Storage again, and click `Settings` on the left navigation menu.
4. Click `Interoperability` tab. This is where you will create Amazon S3-compatible ID and access keys.
5. Copy the value in `Storage URI`. You will need this for the Endpoint value in Dokploy.
6. Under `Service account HMAC`, click `Create a key for a service account`. Select the service account you created earlier and click `Create`. You will get an Access Key and a Secret Key.

Now copy the following variables:

(from) Cloud Storage(to) DokployExample value`Access Key``Access Key ID``f3811c6d27415a9s6cv943b6743ad784``Secret``Secret Access Key``aa55ee40b4049e93b7252bf698408cc22a3c2856d2530s7c1cb7670e318f15e58``Location``Region``us-central1, etc` it will depend on the region you are using.`Endpoint``Endpoint``https://storage.googleapis.com`. The value in `Storage URI`.`Bucket Name``Bucket``dokploy-backups` use the name of the bucket you created.

Test the connection and you should see a success message.
