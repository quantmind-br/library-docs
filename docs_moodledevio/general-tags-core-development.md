## [Backporting](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/backporting)

Whilst we'd all like all Moodle users to be using our latest and greatest code, there is a balance to strike between improving our software and maintaining stability (both in terms of regressions, but also training and documentation materials). Large amounts of change on the stable branches make the lives difficult for institutions to manage upgrades between point releases.

## [Component Library](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/component-library)

The Component Library is a tool designed for developers to identify frequently used user interface (UI) components and encourage their reuse within Moodle. It includes both components from Twitter Bootstrap and Moodle itself. The library provides an organized display of these components, showcasing them with your current Moodle theme.

## [Contributing](https://moodledev.io/general/community/contribute)

If you want to contribute to Moodle, you can start looking at the following:

## [Deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation)

Deprecation, in its programming sense, is the process of taking older code and marking it as no longer being useful within the codebase, usually because it has been superseded by newer code. The deprecated code is not immediately removed from the codebase because doing so may cause regression errors.
