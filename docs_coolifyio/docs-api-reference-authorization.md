# Authorization

API request requires a `Bearer` token in `Authorization` header, which could be generated from the UI.

## Access

The API can be accessed through `http://<ip>:8000/api`.

With the exception of `/health` and `/feedback`, all routes are additionally prefixed with `/v1` resulting in the base route `http://<ip>:8000/api/v1`.

## Generate

1. Go to `Keys & Tokens` / `API tokens`.
2. Define a name for your token and click `Create New Token`.

::: success Tip
You will see the token once, so make sure to copy it and store it in a safe place.
:::

## Scope

The token will only be able to access resources that are owned by the team that the token is scoped to.

```php
# Sample token

```

## Permissions

::: warning HEADS UP!
Some API data won't get returned if the API token doesn't have correct permissions
:::

Currently there are three types of permissions:

* read-only `(default)`
* read:sensitive
* view:sensitive
* `*` (all permissions)

### `read-only`

With this permission, you can only read data from the API, but you can't create, update, or delete any resources. Also you can't see sensitive data.

### `read:sensitive`

With this permission, you can only read data from the API and see sensitive information that is normally redacted. You cannot create, update, or delete any resources.

### `view:sensitive`

Without this permission, passwords, api keys, and other sensitive data will be redacted from the API response.

### `*`

Full access to all resources and sensitive data.
