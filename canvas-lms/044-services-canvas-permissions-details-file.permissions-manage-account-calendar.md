#### Account Calendars - add / edit / delete events

Allows user to add, edit, and delete events in account calendars.

#### Account Calendars - change visibility

### Additional Considerations

Even with the Account Calendars - add / edit / delete events permission enabled, events can only be created in account calendars that are visible.
