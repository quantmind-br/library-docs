## Understanding AI Agents

AI Agents in Zencoder are customizable, and sharable agents transforming how you code. Whether you’re using our prebuilt agents or creating custom ones, these intelligent agents can be called for selected code or entire files directly in your IDE, helping you automate repetitive tasks, maintain coding standards, and improve your overall development efficiency.

## Navigating Agent Categories

At the top of the AI Agents screen, you’ll find tabs that help you filter and navigate between different types of agents:

## Creating and Managing AI Agents

## Using the Agents Marketplace

The Zencoder Agents Marketplace is constantly growing! We’re regularly adding new specialized agents to help with different aspects of your development workflow.

### Browsing the Marketplace

The marketplace contains specialized agents for various development tasks, from bug prevention to documentation generation. Visit the marketplace to explore all available agents.

### Using Agents from the Marketplace

Our Zencoder extension allows you to integrate powerful coding agents directly into your IDE. Follow these steps to browse and use agents from our Marketplace.

### Contributing Your Own Agents

We encourage all users to contribute to the Agents Marketplace! Whether you’ve created a specialized agent for a specific framework, language, or development task, sharing it helps grow our community of developers.

## Using Agents in Your Workflow

Once configured, you can use agents by:

1. Selecting code in your editor or focusing on an entire file
2. Invoking the agent using its command (e.g., `/unittests`, `/review`)
3. The agent will perform its specialized task on the selected code
