Context engineering is about building background knowledge, preferences, and workflows that help goose work more effectively. Instead of repeating instructions, you define them once and teach goose how you work.

## 📚 Documentation & Guides

[**Using goosehints**  
\
Use AGENTS.md, .goosehints, and other files to provide project context, preferences, and instructions that goose loads automatically.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/context-engineering/using-goosehints)

[**Using Skills**  
\
Create reusable instruction sets containing workflows, scripts, and other resources that goose can load on demand.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/context-engineering/using-skills)

[**Custom Slash Commands**  
\
Create custom shortcuts to quickly run reusable instructions in any chat session with simple slash commands.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/context-engineering/slash-commands)

[**Memory Extension**  
\
Teach goose persistent knowledge it can recall across sessions. Save commands, code snippets, and preferences for consistent assistance.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/mcp/memory-mcp)

[**Research → Plan → Implement Pattern**  
\
See how slash commands make it easy to integrate instructions into interactive RPI workflows.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/tutorials/rpi)
