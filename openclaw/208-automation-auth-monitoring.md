OpenClaw exposes OAuth expiry health via `openclaw models status`. Use that for automation and alerting; scripts are optional extras for phone workflows.

## Preferred: CLI check (portable)

```
openclaw models status --check
```

Exit codes:

- `0`: OK
- `1`: expired or missing credentials
- `2`: expiring soon (within 24h)

This works in cron/systemd and requires no extra scripts.

## Optional scripts (ops / phone workflows)

These live under `scripts/` and are **optional**. They assume SSH access to the gateway host and are tuned for systemd + Termux.

- `scripts/claude-auth-status.sh` now uses `openclaw models status --json` as the source of truth (falling back to direct file reads if the CLI is unavailable), so keep `openclaw` on `PATH` for timers.
- `scripts/auth-monitor.sh`: cron/systemd timer target; sends alerts (ntfy or phone).
- `scripts/systemd/openclaw-auth-monitor.{service,timer}`: systemd user timer.
- `scripts/claude-auth-status.sh`: Claude Code + OpenClaw auth checker (full/json/simple).
- `scripts/mobile-reauth.sh`: guided re‑auth flow over SSH.
- `scripts/termux-quick-auth.sh`: one‑tap widget status + open auth URL.
- `scripts/termux-auth-widget.sh`: full guided widget flow.
- `scripts/termux-sync-widget.sh`: sync Claude Code creds → OpenClaw.

If you don’t need phone automation or systemd timers, skip these scripts.
