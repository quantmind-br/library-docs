This certificate program is built around eight sequential modules that show how to plan, automate, and scale engineering work with Zencoder. Watch each module’s video and review the key takeaways to apply the workflows inside your own teams.

## Modules

[**Module 1 · Foundations**  
\
Install the agents, prototype a productivity tracker end-to-end, and learn to reuse repo knowledge for faster iterations.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-01)

[**Module 2 · Deep Codebase Understanding**  
\
Connect multi-repo knowledge, configure access tokens, and pick the right LLM models with tooling and system cards.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-02)

[**Module 3 · Custom Workflows**  
\
Encode reusable rules, share custom agents, and extend workflows with MCP tools tailored to your team’s stack.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-03)

[**Module 4 · Automations with Remote Agents**  
\
Wire Jira, Zencoder, and GitHub automations so remote agents can raise pull requests and review them autonomously.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-04)

[**Module 5 · Spec Driven Development**  
\
Use spec-driven development with TDD/BDD plans, agent-assisted research, and collaborative specs to ship aligned features.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-05)

[**Module 6 · Complex Use Cases**  
\
Tackle advanced projects like legacy Java migrations and Figma-to-code builds by crafting specialized agents and MCP integrations.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-06)

[**Module 7 · Working at an Organization**  
\
Roll out org-wide practices for Jira references, shared agents, and multi-repo indexing to keep teams aligned on AI work.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-07)

[**Module 8 · How to Drive AI Adoption**  
\
Lead adoption with champion programs, visible wins, and usage metrics that unlock sustained AI-driven engineering change.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/learn/10x-engineer/module-08)
