Allows user to create course pages.

Allows user to delete course pages.

Allows user to edit course pages.

Allows user to define users allowed to edit the page.

Allows user to add page to student to-do list.

Allows user to publish and unpublish pages.

Allows user to view page history and set front page.

Allows user to edit Blueprint Course lock settings in the Pages index page and for an individual page in a Blueprint master course.

### Additional Considerations

Blueprint courses must be enabled for an account by an admin.

To edit lock settings on the Pages index page, Pages - update, Blueprint Courses - add / edit / associate / delete, and Courses - manage.

However, if these additional permissions are enabled, but the Pages - update permission is not enabled, the user can still adjust content lock settings on individual pages in a Blueprint Master Course.

Students can edit and view page history if allowed in the options for an individual page.
