## Using the Compose SDK

Requires: Docker Compose [5.0.0](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/v5.0.0) and later

The `docker/compose` package can be used as a Go library by third-party applications to programmatically manage containerized applications defined in Compose files. This SDK provides a comprehensive API that lets you integrate Compose functionality directly into your applications, allowing you to load, validate, and manage multi-container environments without relying on the Compose CLI.

Whether you need to orchestrate containers as part of a deployment pipeline, build custom management tools, or embed container orchestration into your application, the Compose SDK offers the same powerful capabilities that drive the Docker Compose command-line tool.

To get started, create an SDK instance using the `NewComposeService()` function, which initializes a service with the necessary configuration to interact with the Docker daemon and manage Compose projects. This service instance provides methods for all core Compose operations including creating, starting, stopping, and removing containers, as well as loading and validating Compose files. The service handles the underlying Docker API interactions and resource management, allowing you to focus on your application logic.

### [Requirements](#requirements)

Before using the SDK, make sure you're using a compatible version of the Docker CLI.

Docker CLI version 29.0.0 and later depends on the new `github.com/moby/moby` module, whereas Docker Compose v5 currently depends on `github.com/docker/docker`. This means you need to pin `docker/cli v28.5.2+incompatible` to ensure compatibility and avoid build errors.

### [Example usage](#example-usage)

Here's a basic example demonstrating how to load a Compose project and start the services:

This example demonstrates the core workflow - creating a service instance, loading a project from a Compose file, and starting the services. The SDK provides many additional operations for managing the lifecycle of your containerized application.

The `NewComposeService()` function accepts optional `compose.Option` parameters to customize the SDK behavior. These options allow you to configure I/O streams, concurrency limits, dry-run mode, and other advanced features.

### [Available options](#available-options)

- `WithOutputStream(io.Writer)`: Redirect standard output to a custom writer
- `WithErrorStream(io.Writer)`: Redirect error output to a custom writer
- `WithInputStream(io.Reader)`: Provide a custom input stream for interactive prompts
- `WithStreams(out, err, in)`: Set all I/O streams at once
- `WithMaxConcurrency(int)`: Limit the number of concurrent operations against the Docker API
- `WithPrompt(Prompt)`: Customize user confirmation behavior (use `AlwaysOkPrompt()` for non-interactive mode)
- `WithDryRun`: Run operations in dry-run mode without actually applying changes
- `WithContextInfo(api.ContextInfo)`: Set custom Docker context information
- `WithProxyConfig(map[string]string)`: Configure HTTP proxy settings for builds
- `WithEventProcessor(progress.EventProcessor)`: Receive progress events and operation notifications

These options provide fine-grained control over the SDK's behavior, making it suitable for various integration scenarios including CLI tools, web services, automation scripts, and testing environments.

The `EventProcessor` interface allows you to monitor Compose operations in real-time by receiving events about changes applied to Docker resources such as images, containers, volumes, and networks. This is particularly useful for building user interfaces, logging systems, or monitoring tools that need to track the progress of Compose operations.

### [Understanding `EventProcessor`](#understanding-eventprocessor)

A Compose operation, such as `up`, `down`, `build`, performs a series of changes to Docker resources. The `EventProcessor` receives notifications about these changes through three key methods:

- `Start(ctx, operation)`: Called when a Compose operation begins, for example `up`
- `On(events...)`: Called with progress events for individual resource changes, for example, container starting, image being pulled
- `Done(operation, success)`: Called when the operation completes, indicating success or failure

Each event contains information about the resource being modified, its current status, and progress indicators when applicable (such as download progress for image pulls).

### [Event status types](#event-status-types)

Events report resource changes with the following status types:

- Working: Operation is in progress, for example, creating, starting, pulling
- Done: Operation completed successfully
- Warning: Operation completed with warnings
- Error: Operation failed

Common status text values include: `Creating`, `Created`, `Starting`, `Started`, `Running`, `Stopping`, `Stopped`, `Removing`, `Removed`, `Building`, `Built`, `Pulling`, `Pulled`, and more.

### [Built-in `EventProcessor` implementations](#built-in-eventprocessor-implementations)

The SDK provides three ready-to-use `EventProcessor` implementations:

- `progress.NewTTYWriter(io.Writer)`: Renders an interactive terminal UI with progress bars and task lists (similar to the Docker Compose CLI output)
- `progress.NewPlainWriter(io.Writer)`: Outputs simple text-based progress messages suitable for non-interactive environments or log files
- `progress.NewJSONWriter()`: Render events as JSON objects
- `progress.NewQuietWriter()`: (Default) Silently processes events without producing any output

Using `EventProcessor`, a custom UI can be plugged into `docker/compose`.
