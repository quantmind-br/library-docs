## Understanding roles and responsibilities for Docker Hardened Images

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) are curated and maintained by Docker, and built using upstream open source components. To deliver security, reliability, and compliance, responsibilities are shared among three groups:

- Upstream maintainers: the developers and communities responsible for the open source software included in each image.
- Docker: the provider of hardened, signed, and maintained container images.
- You (the customer): the consumer who runs and, optionally, customizes DHIs in your environment.

This topic outlines who handles what, so you can use DHIs effectively and securely.

## [Releases](#releases)

- Upstream: Publishes and maintains official releases of the software components included in DHIs. This includes versioning, changelogs, and deprecation notices.
- Docker: Builds, hardens, and signs Docker Hardened Images based on upstream versions. Docker maintains these images in line with upstream release timelines and internal policies.
- You: Ensure you're staying on supported versions of DHIs and upstream projects. Using outdated or unsupported components can introduce security risk.

## [Patching](#patching)

- Upstream: Maintains and updates the source code for each component, including fixing vulnerabilities in libraries and dependencies.
- Docker: Rebuilds and re-releases images with upstream patches applied. Docker monitors for vulnerabilities and publishes updates to affected images. Only DHI Enterprise includes SLAs. DHI Free offers a secure baseline but no guaranteed remediation timelines.
- You: Apply DHI updates in your environments and patch any software or dependencies you install on top of the base image.

## [Testing](#testing)

- Upstream: Defines the behavior and functionality of the original software, and is responsible for validating core features.
- Docker: Validates that DHIs start, run, and behave consistently with upstream expectations. Docker also runs security scans and includes a [testing attestation](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/core-concepts/attestations/) with each image.
- You: Test your application on top of DHIs and validate that any changes or customizations function as expected in your environment.

## [Security and compliance](#security-and-compliance)

- Docker: Publishes signed SBOMs, VEX documents, provenance data, and CVE scan results with each image to support compliance and supply chain security.
  
  - For free DHI users: All security metadata and transparency features are included at no cost.
  - For DHI Enterprise users: Additional compliance variants (like FIPS and STIG) and customization capabilities are available, with automatic rebuilds when base images are patched.
- You: Integrate DHIs into your security and compliance workflows, including vulnerability management and auditing.

## [Support](#support)

- Docker:
  
  - For free DHI users: Community support and public documentation are available.
  - For DHI Enterprise users: Access to Docker's enterprise support team for mission-critical applications.
- You: Monitor Docker's release notes, security advisories, and documentation for updates and best practices.

## [Summary](#summary)

Docker Hardened Images give you a secure foundation, complete with signed metadata and upstream transparency. Your role is to make informed use of these images, apply updates promptly, and validate that your configurations and applications meet your internal requirements.
