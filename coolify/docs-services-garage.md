# Garage

## What is Garage?

Garage is a lightweight geo-distributed data store that implements the Amazon S3 object storage protocol. It enables applications to store large blobs such as pictures, video, images, documents, etc., in a redundant multi-node setting. S3 is versatile enough to also be used to publish a static website.
