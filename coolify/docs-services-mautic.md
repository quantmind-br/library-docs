# Mautic

::: danger SERVICE REMOVED FROM COOLIFY
This service has been removed from Coolify’s one-click service catalog because the official Docker images no longer include AMQP transport, so RabbitMQ integration does not work with our template. More info on https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/8088
