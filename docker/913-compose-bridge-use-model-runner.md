## Use Docker Model Runner with Compose Bridge

Table of contents

* * *

Compose Bridge supports model-aware deployments. It can deploy and configure Docker Model Runner, a lightweight service that hosts and serves machine LLMs.

This reduces manual setup for LLM-enabled services and keeps deployments consistent across Docker Desktop and Kubernetes environments.

If you have a `models` top-level element in your `compose.yaml` file, Compose Bridge:

- Automatically injects environment variables for each model’s endpoint and name.
- Configures model endpoints differently for Docker Desktop vs Kubernetes.
- Optionally deploys Docker Model Runner in Kubernetes when enabled in Helm values

## [Configure model runner settings](#configure-model-runner-settings)

When deploying using generated Helm Charts, you can control the model runner configuration through Helm values.

```
# Model Runner settingsmodelRunner:# Set to false for Docker Desktop (uses host instance)# Set to true for standalone Kubernetes clustersenabled:false# Endpoint used when enabled=false (Docker Desktop)hostEndpoint:"http://host.docker.internal:12434/engines/v1/"# Deployment settings when enabled=trueimage:"docker/model-runner:latest"imagePullPolicy:"IfNotPresent"# GPU supportgpu:enabled:falsevendor:"nvidia"# nvidia or amdcount:1# Node scheduling (uncomment and customize as needed)# nodeSelector:#   accelerator: nvidia-tesla-t4# tolerations: []# affinity: {}# Security contextsecurityContext:allowPrivilegeEscalation:false# Environment variables (uncomment and add as needed)# env:#   DMR_ORIGINS: "http://localhost:31246"resources:limits:cpu:"1000m"memory:"2Gi"requests:cpu:"100m"memory:"256Mi"# Storage for modelsstorage:size:"100Gi"storageClass:""# Empty uses default storage class# Models to pre-pullmodels:- ai/qwen2.5:latest- ai/mxbai-embed-large

## [Deploying a model runner](#deploying-a-model-runner)

### [Docker Desktop](#docker-desktop)

When `modelRunner.enabled` is `false`, Compose Bridge configures your workloads to connect to Docker Model Runner running on the host:

```
http://host.docker.internal:12434/engines/v1/
```

The endpoint is automatically injected into your service containers.

### [Kubernetes](#kubernetes)

When `modelRunner.enabled` is `true`, Compose Bridge uses the generated manifests to deploy Docker Model Runner in your cluster, including:

- Deployment: Runs the `docker-model-runner` container
- Service: Exposes port `80` (maps to container port `12434`)
- `PersistentVolumeClaim`: Stores model files

The `modelRunner.enabled` setting also determines the number of replicas for the `model-runner-deployment`:

- When `true`, the deployment replica count is set to 1, and Docker Model Runner is deployed in the Kubernetes cluster.
- When `false`, the replica count is 0, and no Docker Model Runner resources are deployed.
