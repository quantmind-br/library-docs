## Primitive Type f128

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`f128` [#116909](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/116909))

Expand description

A 128-bit floating-point type (specifically, the “binary128” type defined in IEEE 754-2008).

This type is very similar to [`f32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html "primitive f32") and [`f64`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html "primitive f64"), but has increased precision by using twice as many bits as `f64`. Please see [the documentation for `f32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html "primitive f32") or [Wikipedia on quad-precision values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format) for more information.

Note that no platforms have hardware support for `f128` without enabling target specific features, as for all instruction set architectures `f128` is considered an optional feature. Only Power ISA (“PowerPC”) and RISC-V (via the Q extension) specify it, and only certain microarchitectures actually implement it. For x86-64 and AArch64, ISA support is not even specified, so it will always be a software implementation significantly slower than `f64`.

*Note: `f128` support is incomplete. Many platforms will not be able to link math functions. On x86 in particular, these functions do link but their results are always incorrect.*

*[See also the `std::f128::consts` module](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/f128/consts/index.html "mod std::f128::consts").*

[Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/num/f128.rs.html#53-55)

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`f128` [#116909](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/116909))

Raises a number to a floating point power.

Note that this function is special in that it can return non-NaN results for NaN inputs. For example, `f128::powf(f128::NAN, 0.0)` returns `1.0`. However, if an input is a *signaling* NaN, then the result is non-deterministically either a NaN or the result that the corresponding quiet NaN would produce.

##### [§](#unspecified-precision)Unspecified precision

The precision of this function is non-deterministic. This means it varies by platform, Rust version, and can even differ within the same execution from one invocation to the next.

##### [§](#examples)Examples

```rust
#![feature(f128)]

let x = 2.0_f128;
let abs_difference = (x.powf(2.0) - (x * x)).abs();
assert!(abs_difference <= f128::EPSILON);

assert_eq!(f128::powf(1.0, f128::NAN), 1.0);
assert_eq!(f128::powf(f128::NAN, 0.0), 1.0);
assert_eq!(f128::powf(0.0, 0.0), 1.0);

Not a Number (NaN).

Note that IEEE 754 doesn’t define just a single NaN value; a plethora of bit patterns are considered to be NaN. Furthermore, the standard makes a difference between a “signaling” and a “quiet” NaN, and allows inspecting its “payload” (the unspecified bits in the bit pattern) and its sign. See the [specification of NaN bit patterns](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#nan-bit-patterns "primitive f32") for more info.

This constant is guaranteed to be a quiet NaN (on targets that follow the Rust assumptions that the quiet/signaling bit being set to 1 indicates a quiet NaN). Beyond that, nothing is guaranteed about the specific bit pattern chosen here: both payload and sign are arbitrary. The concrete bit pattern may change across Rust versions and target platforms.

- if `self.is_nan()`, this returns `self`;
- if `self` is [`INFINITY`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f128.html#associatedconstant.INFINITY "associated constant f128::INFINITY"), this returns [`MAX`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f128.html#associatedconstant.MAX "associated constant f128::MAX");
- if `self` is `TINY`, this returns 0.0;
- if `self` is -0.0 or +0.0, this returns `-TINY`;
- if `self` is [`MIN`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f128.html#associatedconstant.MIN "associated constant f128::MIN") or [`NEG_INFINITY`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f128.html#associatedconstant.NEG_INFINITY "associated constant f128::NEG_INFINITY"), this returns [`NEG_INFINITY`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f128.html#associatedconstant.NEG_INFINITY "associated constant f128::NEG_INFINITY");
- otherwise the unique greatest value less than `self` is returned.

The identity `x.next_down() == -(-x).next_up()` holds for all non-NaN `x`. When `x` is finite `x == x.next_down().next_up()` also holds.

```rust
#![feature(f128)]

let x = 1.0f128;
// Clamp value into range [0, 1).
let clamped = x.clamp(0.0, 1.0f128.next_down());
assert!(clamped < 1.0);
assert_eq!(clamped.next_up(), 1.0);
```

This operation corresponds to IEEE-754 `nextDown`.

Raw transmutation from `u128`.

This is currently identical to `transmute::<u128, f128>(v)` on all platforms. It turns out this is incredibly portable, for two reasons:

- Floats and Ints have the same endianness on all supported platforms.
- IEEE 754 very precisely specifies the bit layout of floats.

However there is one caveat: prior to the 2008 version of IEEE 754, how to interpret the NaN signaling bit wasn’t actually specified. Most platforms (notably x86 and ARM) picked the interpretation that was ultimately standardized in 2008, but some didn’t (notably MIPS). As a result, all signaling NaNs on MIPS are quiet NaNs on x86, and vice-versa.

Rather than trying to preserve signaling-ness cross-platform, this implementation favors preserving the exact bits. This means that any payloads encoded in NaNs will be preserved even if the result of this method is sent over the network from an x86 machine to a MIPS one.

If the results of this method are only manipulated by the same architecture that produced them, then there is no portability concern.

If the input isn’t NaN, then there is no portability concern.

If you don’t care about signalingness (very likely), then there is no portability concern.

Note that this function is distinct from `as` casting, which attempts to preserve the *numeric* value, and not the bitwise value.

Returns the ordering between `self` and `other`.

Unlike the standard partial comparison between floating point numbers, this comparison always produces an ordering in accordance to the `totalOrder` predicate as defined in the IEEE 754 (2008 revision) floating point standard. The values are ordered in the following sequence:

- negative quiet NaN
- negative signaling NaN
- negative infinity
- negative numbers
- negative subnormal numbers
- negative zero
- positive zero
- positive subnormal numbers
- positive numbers
- positive infinity
- positive signaling NaN
- positive quiet NaN.

The ordering established by this function does not always agree with the [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html "trait std::cmp::PartialOrd") and [`PartialEq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html "trait std::cmp::PartialEq") implementations of `f128`. For example, they consider negative and positive zero equal, while `total_cmp` doesn’t.

The interpretation of the signaling NaN bit follows the definition in the IEEE 754 standard, which may not match the interpretation by some of the older, non-conformant (e.g. MIPS) hardware implementations.

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`f128` [#116909](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/116909))

Returns a number composed of the magnitude of `self` and the sign of `sign`.

Equal to `self` if the sign of `self` and `sign` are the same, otherwise equal to `-self`. If `self` is a NaN, then a NaN with the same payload as `self` and the sign bit of `sign` is returned.

If `sign` is a NaN, then this operation will still carry over its sign into the result. Note that IEEE 754 doesn’t assign any meaning to the sign bit in case of a NaN, and as Rust doesn’t guarantee that the bit pattern of NaNs are conserved over arithmetic operations, the result of `copysign` with `sign` being a NaN might produce an unexpected or non-portable result. See the [specification of NaN bit patterns](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#nan-bit-patterns "primitive f32") for more info.

Fused multiply-add. Computes `(self * a) + b` with only one rounding error, yielding a more accurate result than an unfused multiply-add.

Using `mul_add` *may* be more performant than an unfused multiply-add if the target architecture has a dedicated `fma` CPU instruction. However, this is not always true, and will be heavily dependant on designing algorithms with specific target hardware in mind.

Calculates Euclidean division, the matching method for `rem_euclid`.

This computes the integer `n` such that `self = n * rhs + self.rem_euclid(rhs)`. In other words, the result is `self / rhs` rounded to the integer `n` such that `self >= n * rhs`.

Calculates the least nonnegative remainder of `self` when divided by `rhs`.

In particular, the return value `r` satisfies `0.0 <= r < rhs.abs()` in most cases. However, due to a floating point round-off error it can result in `r == rhs.abs()`, violating the mathematical definition, if `self` is much smaller than `rhs.abs()` in magnitude and `self < 0.0`. This result is not an element of the function’s codomain, but it is the closest floating point number in the real numbers and thus fulfills the property `self == self.div_euclid(rhs) * rhs + self.rem_euclid(rhs)` approximately.

Raises a number to an integer power.

Using this function is generally faster than using `powf`. It might have a different sequence of rounding operations than `powf`, so the results are not guaranteed to agree.

Note that this function is special in that it can return non-NaN results for NaN inputs. For example, `f128::powi(f128::NAN, 0)` returns `1.0`. However, if an input is a *signaling* NaN, then the result is non-deterministically either a NaN or the result that the corresponding quiet NaN would produce.

##### [§](#unspecified-precision-31)Unspecified precision
