## [Clock](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/core/clock)

Fetching the current time

## [Testing](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/plugintypes/tiny/testing)

Testing is an important part of development and we strongly encourage you to write appropriate tests for your plugins.

## [Unit Testing](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/subsystems/routing/testing)

One of the benefits of using routes is how easy they are to unit test. It is also possible to test parameters for validation, which is especially useful for mapped parameters.
