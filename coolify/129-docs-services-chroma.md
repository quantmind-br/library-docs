# Chroma

## What is Chroma?

Chroma is an open-source, AI-native vector database designed for building applications with embeddings. It provides a simple way to store, retrieve, and search vector embeddings for machine learning applications, particularly those involving large language models (LLMs) and semantic search. Chroma handles the complexities of vector operations, similarity search, and metadata filtering, making it ideal for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and other AI applications.
