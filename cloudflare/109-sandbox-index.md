Build secure, isolated code execution environments

Available on Workers Paid plan

The Sandbox SDK enables you to run untrusted code securely in isolated environments. Built on [Containers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/), Sandbox SDK provides a simple API for executing commands, managing files, running background processes, and exposing services — all from your [Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) applications.

Sandboxes are ideal for building AI agents that need to execute code, interactive development environments, data analysis platforms, CI/CD systems, and any application that needs secure code execution at the edge. Each sandbox runs in its own isolated container with a full Linux environment, providing strong security boundaries while maintaining performance.

With Sandbox, you can execute Python scripts, run Node.js applications, analyze data, compile code, and perform complex computations — all with a simple TypeScript API and no infrastructure to manage.

* Execute Commands

  ```typescript
  import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
      const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');


      // Execute a command and get the result
      const result = await sandbox.exec('python --version');


      return Response.json({
        output: result.stdout,
        exitCode: result.exitCode,
        success: result.success
      });
    }
  };
  ```

* Code Interpreter

  ```typescript
  import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
      const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');


      // Create a Python execution context
      const ctx = await sandbox.createCodeContext({ language: 'python' });


      // Execute Python code with automatic result capture
      const result = await sandbox.runCode(`
  import pandas as pd
  data = {'product': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'sales': [100, 200, 150]}
  df = pd.DataFrame(data)
  df['sales'].sum()  # Last expression is automatically returned
    `, { context: ctx });


        return Response.json({
          result: result.results?.[0]?.text,
          logs: result.logs
        });
      }
    };
  ```

* File Operations

  ```typescript
  import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
      const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');


      // Create a project structure
      await sandbox.mkdir('/workspace/project/src', { recursive: true });


      // Write files
      await sandbox.writeFile(
        '/workspace/project/package.json',
        JSON.stringify({ name: 'my-app', version: '1.0.0' })
      );


      // Read a file back
      const content = await sandbox.readFile('/workspace/project/package.json');


      return Response.json({ content });
    }
  };
  ```

* WebSocket Connections

  ```typescript
  import { getSandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export { Sandbox } from '@cloudflare/sandbox';


  export default {
    async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
      // Connect to WebSocket services in sandbox
      if (request.headers.get('Upgrade')?.toLowerCase() === 'websocket') {
        const sandbox = getSandbox(env.Sandbox, 'user-123');
        return await sandbox.wsConnect(request, 8080);
      }


      return Response.json({ message: 'WebSocket endpoint' });
    }
  };
  ```
