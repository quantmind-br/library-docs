## Item Banks - manage account

Allows a user to view and manage all item banks in an account directly from within a course and account.

### Additional Considerations

This permission must be disabled for users to only view item banks created by them, shared with them from another user, or shared indirectly via the course they are enrolled in as an instructor.
