Allows admin user to view account statistics.

#### Admin Tools (Logging tab)

Allows user to generate login/logout activity report in Admin Tools.

### Additional Considerations

#### Admin Tools (Logging tab)

If Statistics - view or Users - manage login details is enabled, the user will be able to generate login/logout activity in Admin Tools. To hide the login/logout activity option in Admin Tools, both of these permissions need to be disabled.

To view user page views, Users - view list must also be enabled.

Not available at the subaccount level.
