In this section, learn how to manage access and view usage of the Docker products for your organization. For more detailed information about each product, including how to set up and configure them, see the following manuals:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/)
- [Docker Build Cloud](https://docs.docker.com/build-cloud/)
- [Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/)

- [Docker Offload](https://docs.docker.com/offload/)

## [Manage product access for your organization](#manage-product-access-for-your-organization)

Access to the Docker products included in your subscription is turned on by default for all users. For an overview of products included in your subscription, see [Docker subscriptions and features](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

### [Manage Docker Desktop access](#manage-docker-desktop-access)

To manage Docker Desktop access:

1. [Enforce sign-in](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/enforce-sign-in/).
2. Manage members [manually](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/members/) or use [provisioning](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/provisioning/).

With sign-in enforced, only users who are a member of your organization can use Docker Desktop after signing in.

### [Manage Docker Build Cloud access](#manage-docker-build-cloud-access)

2. Select **Account settings**.
3. Select **Lock access to Docker Build Account**.

### [Manage Docker Scout access](#manage-docker-scout-access)

### [Manage Docker Offload access](#manage-docker-offload-access)

> Note
> 
> Docker Offload isn't included in the core Docker subscription plans. To make Docker Offload available, you must [sign up](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-offload/) and subscribe.

To manage Docker Offload access for your organization, use [Settings Management](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/):

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) as an organization owner.
2. Select **Admin Console** &gt; **Desktop Settings Management**.
3. Configure the **Enable Docker Offload** setting to control whether Docker Offload features are available in Docker Desktop. You can configure this setting in five states:
   
   - **Always enabled**: Docker Offload is always enabled and users cannot disable it. The Offload toggle is always visible in Docker Desktop header. Recommended for VDI environments where local Docker execution is not possible.
   - **Enabled**: Docker Offload is enabled by default but users can disable it in Docker Desktop settings. Suitable for hybrid environments.
   - **Disabled**: Docker Offload is disabled by default but users can enable it in Docker Desktop settings.
   - **Always disabled**: Docker Offload is disabled and users cannot enable it. The option is visible but locked. Use when Docker Offload is not approved for organizational use.
   - **User defined**: No enforced default. Users choose whether to enable or disable Docker Offload in their Docker Desktop settings.
4. Select **Save**.

For more details on Settings Management, see the [Settings reference](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/settings-reference/#enable-docker-offload).
