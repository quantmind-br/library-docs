Zencoder provides a collection of AI agents designed to support your development workflow. These specialized agents can handle everything from answering questions about your code to generating comprehensive test suites and managing complex multi-file operations.

## Accessing Agents

All agents are easily accessible through a unified interface:

## Core Agents

These specialized agents are built and maintained by Zencoder, each designed for specific development tasks and workflows.

[**Ask Agent**  
\
Your primary interface for asking questions about your codebase. Get explanations, seek guidance on best practices, and receive contextually relevant answers based on your project’s structure and code.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/qa-agent)

[**Coding Agent**  
\
The primary development agent and workhorse of Zencoder. Generates, modifies, and refactors code across multiple files and languages with deep codebase understanding, validation, and error correction.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/coding-agent)

[**Web Dev Agent**  
\
Purpose-built for modern web development workflows. Transforms designs and specifications into production-ready UI code, validates implementations through browser testing, and iterates based on real browser feedback.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/web-dev-agent)

[**Unit Testing Agent**  
\
Generates comprehensive test suites for individual components and functions. Creates appropriate mocks, assertions, and test cases tailored to your testing framework and coding patterns.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/unit-testing)

[**E2E Testing Agent**  
\
Creates end-to-end tests for web applications using Playwright. Simulates user interactions, validates complete workflows, and ensures your application behaves correctly across different scenarios.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/e2e-testing)

[**Repo-Info Agent**  
\
Creates and maintains comprehensive project snapshots that improve all other agents’ understanding. Analyzes your project structure, dependencies, and conventions to provide persistent context.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/repo-info-agent)

## AI Agents (Zen Agents)

Beyond the core agents, Zencoder enables you to create and use custom AI agents tailored to your specific workflows and requirements.

[**Custom AI Agents**  
\
Create specialized agents for recurring tasks like code refactoring, documentation updates, or domain-specific workflows. These agents can be shared with your team and customized to match your development standards and practices.](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/ai-agents)
