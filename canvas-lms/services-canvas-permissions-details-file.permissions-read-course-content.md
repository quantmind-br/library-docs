Allows user to view published and unpublished course content.

### Additional Considerations

#### Admin Tools (Undelete Courses)

If Courses - manage and Courses - undelete are also enabled, an account-level user will be able to restore deleted courses in Admin Tools.

If disabled, user will still have access to Course Settings.

User cannot manage individual course content without the appropriate permission for that content item.

If course visibility is limited to users enrolled in the course, this permission allows the user to view course content without being enrolled in the course.

To view the Gradebook, Grades - view all grades must also be enabled.
