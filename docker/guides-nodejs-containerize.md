## Containerize a Node.js application

Before you begin, make sure the following tools are installed and available on your system:

- You have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
- You have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The examples in this section use a command-line based git client, but you can use any client.

> **New to Docker?**  
> Start with the [Docker basics](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/) guide to get familiar with key concepts like images, containers, and Dockerfiles.

* * *

This guide walks you through the complete process of containerizing a Node.js application with Docker. You’ll learn how to create a production-ready Docker image using best practices that enhance performance, security, scalability, and operational efficiency.

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Containerize a Node.js application using Docker.
- Create and optimize a Dockerfile tailored for Node.js environments.
- Use multi-stage builds to separate dependencies and reduce image size.
- Configure the container for secure, efficient runtime using a non-root user.
- Follow best practices for building secure, lightweight, and maintainable Docker images.

Clone the sample application to use with this guide. Open a terminal, change directory to a directory that you want to work in, and run the following command to clone the git repository:

Docker provides an interactive CLI tool called `docker init` that helps scaffold the necessary configuration files for containerizing your application. This includes generating a `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `compose.yaml`, and `README.Docker.md`.

To begin, navigate to the root of your project directory:

Then run the following command:

You’ll see output similar to:

The CLI will prompt you with a few questions about your app setup. For consistency, use the same responses shown in the example following when prompted:

QuestionAnswerWhat application platform does your project use?NodeWhat version of Node do you want to use?24.11.1-alpineWhich package manager do you want to use?npmDo you want to run "npm run build" before starting server?yesWhat directory is your build output to?distWhat command do you want to use to start the app?npm run devWhat port does your server listen on?3000

After completion, your project directory will contain the following new files:

While `docker init` generates a basic `compose.yaml` file, you'll need to create a more comprehensive configuration for this full-stack application. Replace the generated `compose.yaml` with a production-ready configuration.

Create a new file named `compose.yml` in your project root:

This Docker Compose configuration includes:

- **Development service** (`app-dev`): Full development environment with hot reload, debugging support, and bind mounts
- **Production service** (`app-prod`): Optimized production deployment with resource limits and security hardening
- **Database service** (`db`): PostgreSQL 16 with persistent storage and health checks
- **Networking**: Isolated network for secure service communication
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for database data

Create a `.env` file to configure your application settings:

Update the `.env` file with your preferred settings:

* * *

The default Dockerfile generated by `docker init` provides a reliable baseline for standard Node.js applications. However, since this project is a full-stack TypeScript application that includes both a backend API and frontend React components, the Dockerfile should be customized to better support and optimize this specific architecture.

### [Review the generated files](#review-the-generated-files)

In the following step, you’ll improve the Dockerfile and configuration files by following best practices:

- Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image clean and small
- Improve performance and security by only including what’s needed

These updates make your app easier to deploy and faster to load.

> A `Dockerfile` is a plain text file that contains step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image. It automates packaging your application along with its dependencies and runtime environment.  
> For full details, see the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/).

### [Step 1: Configure the Dockerfile](#step-1-configure-the-dockerfile)

Before creating a Dockerfile, you need to choose a base image. You can either use the [Node.js Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) or a Docker Hardened Image (DHI) from the [Hardened Image catalog](https://hub.docker.com/hardened-images/catalog).

Choosing DHI offers the advantage of a production-ready image that is lightweight and secure. For more information, see [Docker Hardened Images](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/).

> This guide uses a stable Node.js LTS image tag that is considered secure when the guide is written. Because new releases and security patches are published regularly, the tag shown here may no longer be the safest option when you follow the guide. Always review the latest available image tags and select a secure, up-to-date version before building or deploying your application.
> 
> Official Node.js Docker Images: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) are available for Node.js on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/hardened-images/catalog/dhi/node). Unlike using the Docker Official Image, you must first mirror the Node.js image into your organization and then use it as your base image. Follow the instructions in the [DHI quickstart](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/get-started/) to create a mirrored repository for Node.js.

Mirrored repositories must start with `dhi-`, for example: `FROM <your-namespace>/dhi-node:<tag>`. In the following Dockerfile, the `FROM` instruction uses `<your-namespace>/dhi-node:24-alpine3.22-dev` as the base image.

Now you need to create a production-ready multi-stage Dockerfile. Replace the generated Dockerfile with the following optimized configuration:

Key features of this Dockerfile:

- Multi-stage structure — Separate stages for dependencies, build, development, production, and testing to keep each phase clean and efficient.
- Lean production image — Optimized layering reduces size and keeps only what’s required to run the app.
- Security-minded setup — Uses a dedicated non-root user and excludes unnecessary packages.
- Performance-friendly design — Effective use of caching and well-structured layers for faster builds.
- Clean runtime environment — Removes files not needed in production, such as docs, tests, and build caches.
- Straightforward port usage — The app runs on port 3000 internally, exposed externally as port 8080.
- Memory-optimized runtime — Node.js is configured to run with a smaller memory limit than the default.

### [Step 2: Configure the .dockerignore file](#step-2-configure-the-dockerignore-file)

The `.dockerignore` file tells Docker which files and folders to exclude when building the image.

> This helps:
> 
> - Reduce image size
> - Speed up the build process
> - Prevent sensitive or unnecessary files (like `.env`, `.git`, or `node_modules`) from being added to the final image.
> 
> To learn more, visit the [.dockerignore reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#dockerignore-file).

Copy and replace the contents of your existing `.dockerignore` with the optimized configuration:

### [Step 3: Build the Node.js application image](#step-3-build-the-nodejs-application-image)

After creating all the configuration files, your project directory should now contain all necessary Docker configuration files:

Now you can build the Docker image for your Node.js application.

> The `docker build` command packages your application into an image using the instructions in the Dockerfile. It includes all necessary files from the current directory (called the [build context](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#what-is-a-build-context)).

Run the following command from the root of your project:

What this command does:

- Uses the Dockerfile in the current directory (.)
- Targets the production stage of the multi-stage build
- Packages the application and its dependencies into a Docker image
- Tags the image as docker-nodejs-sample so you can reference it later

#### [Step 4: View local images](#step-4-view-local-images)

After building your Docker image, you can check which images are available on your local machine using either the Docker CLI or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/images/). Since you're already working in the terminal, use the Docker CLI.

To list all locally available Docker images, run the following command:

Example Output:

This output provides key details about your images:

- **Repository** – The name assigned to the image.
- **Tag** – A version label that helps identify different builds (e.g., latest).
- **Image ID** – A unique identifier for the image.
- **Created** – The timestamp indicating when the image was built.
- **Size** – The total disk space used by the image.

If the build was successful, you should see `docker-nodejs-sample` image listed.

* * *

In the previous step, you created a Dockerfile for your Node.js application and built a Docker image using the docker build command. Now it’s time to run that image in a container and verify that your application works as expected.

Inside the `docker-nodejs-sample` directory, run the following command in a terminal.

The development application will start with both servers:

- **API Server**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Express.js backend with REST API
- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) - Vite dev server with React frontend
- **Health Check**: [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health) - Application health status

For production deployment, you can use:

Which serves the full-stack app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with the Express server running on port 3000 internally, mapped to port 8080 externally.

You should see a modern Todo List application with React 19 and a fully functional REST API.

Press `CTRL + C` in the terminal to stop your application.

### [Run the application in the background](#run-the-application-in-the-background)

You can run the application detached from the terminal by adding the `-d` option. Inside the `docker-nodejs-sample` directory, run the following command in a terminal.

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (API) or [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (frontend). You should see the Todo application running.

To confirm that the container is running, use `docker ps` command:

This will list all active containers along with their ports, names, and status. Look for a container exposing ports 3000, 5173, and 9229 for the development app.

Example Output:

### [Run different profiles](#run-different-profiles)

You can run different configurations using Docker Compose profiles:

To stop the application, run:

> For more information about Compose commands, see the [Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/).

In this guide, you learned how to containerize, build, and run a Node.js application using Docker. By following best practices, you created a secure, optimized, and production-ready setup.

What you accomplished:

- Initialized your project using `docker init` to scaffold essential Docker configuration files.
- Created a `compose.yml` file with development, production, and database services.
- Set up environment configuration with a `.env` file for flexible deployment settings.
- Replaced the default `Dockerfile` with a multi-stage build optimized for TypeScript and React.
- Replaced the default `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and keep the image clean and efficient.
- Built your Docker image using `docker build`.
- Ran the container using `docker compose up`, both in the foreground and in detached mode.
- Verified that the app was running by visiting [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (production) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (development).
- Learned how to stop the containerized application using `docker compose down`.

You now have a fully containerized Node.js application, running in a Docker container, and ready for deployment across any environment with confidence and consistency.
