# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

* **Name:**
* **What to call them:**
* **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
* **Timezone:**
* **Notes:**

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

***

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
