You can add or remove seats from your Docker Team or Business subscription at any time to accommodate team changes. When you add seats mid-billing cycle, you're charged a prorated amount for the additional seats.

For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

Docker offers volume pricing for Docker Business subscriptions starting at 25 seats. Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/pricing/contact-sales/) for more information.

You can remove seats from your Team or Business subscription at any time. Changes apply to your next billing cycle, and unused portions aren't refundable.

For example, if you're billed on the 8th of every month for 10 seats and remove 2 seats on the 15th, the 2 seats remain available until your next billing cycle. Your payment for 8 seats begins on the next billing cycle.
