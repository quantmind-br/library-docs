## What is the Agentic Pipeline?

The Agentic Pipeline is an orchestration system that coordinates specialized AI agents for code generation, validation, and improvement. It manages the workflow between different agents, handles error detection and correction, and ensures code quality through automated validation cycles.

## How the Agentic Pipeline Works

The Agentic Pipeline implements this three-stage technical workflow for code generation and validation:

## Agents Powered by the Pipeline

The pipeline architecture enables these specialized agents to perform complex code operations with validation and error correction:
