## Intro

Module 8 shifts from tooling to strategy: champion-led change, story-driven communication, and usage analytics to embed AI coding across the entire engineering org.

## Key takeaways

- Treat adoption as change management—address habits, uncertainty, and quality fears with people-first tactics.
- Launch a champions program: identify early adopters, invest in their training, gather feedback, and position them as go-to peers.
- Share concrete wins and lessons (quantified impact, edge cases, even failures) to build trust and momentum.
- Bake AI check-ins into regular ceremonies (standups, sprint reviews) so usage becomes a natural part of delivery conversations.
- Use the usage dashboard to track adoption patterns, feature usage, and potential future champions; let data steer coaching.
- Avoid top-down mandates; instead create safe experimentation spaces, celebrate progress, and remove obstacles as teams ramp.
