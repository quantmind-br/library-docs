## What is Deno KV

Deno KV is a self-hosted, JavaScript-first key-value database built directly into the Deno runtime. It provides a robust, high-performance data storage solution powered by FoundationDB and SQLite, designed for modern edge computing and serverless applications.

Key features include:

* **ACID Transactions**: Guaranteed data consistency with full ACID transaction support, preventing partial writes and data corruption
* **Built on FoundationDB**: Enterprise-grade backend capable of handling millions of operations per second
* **Real-time Watch API**: Monitor database changes in real-time for building reactive applications, notifications, and live updates
* **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with the Deno runtime, no complex setup required
* **JavaScript Native**: Store any JavaScript value directly without manual serialization
* **Hierarchical Keys**: Organize data with structured, REST-like key patterns for intuitive data modeling
* **Multiple Consistency Levels**: Balance between performance and consistency based on your application needs
* **Self-hosted & Open Source**: MIT licensed with full control over your infrastructure
