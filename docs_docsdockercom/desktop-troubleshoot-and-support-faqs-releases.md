New releases are available roughly every month, unless there are critical fixes that need to be released sooner.

The **Automatically check for updates** setting in the **Software updates** tab is turned on by default. This means you receive notifications in the Docker menu and a notification badge on the Docker Desktop Dashboard when a new version is available.

You can also let Docker Desktop automatically download new updates in the background by selecting the **Always download updates** checkbox.
