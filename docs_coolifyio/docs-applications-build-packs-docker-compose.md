Docker Compose lets you deploy multiple Docker containers and configure them easily.

With the Docker Compose build pack, you can use your own Docker Compose file (i.e. `docker-compose.y[a]ml`) as the single source of truth, giving you full control over how your application is built and deployed on Coolify.

## How to use Docker Compose?

### 1. Create a New Resource in Coolify

On the Coolify dashboard, open your project and click the **Create New Resource** button.

### 2. Choose Your Deployment Option

**A.** If your Git repository is public, choose the **Public Repository** option.

**B.** If your repository is private, you can select **Github App** or **Deploy Key**. (These methods require extra configuration. You can check the guides on setting up a [Github App](/applications/ci-cd/github/integration#with-github-app-recommended) or [Deploy Key](/applications/ci-cd/github/integration#with-deploy-keys) if needed.)

### 3. Select Your Git Repository

If you are using a public repository, paste the URL of your GitHub repository when prompted. The steps are very similar for all other options.

### 4. Choose the Build Pack

Coolify defaults to using Nixpacks. Click the Nixpacks option and select **Docker Compose** as your build pack from the dropdown menu.

### 5. Configure the Build Pack

* **Branch:** Coolify will automatically detect the branch in your repository.
* **Base Directory:** Enter the directory that Coolify should use as the root. Use `/` if your files are at the root or specify a subfolder (like `/backend` for a monorepo).
* **Docker Compose Location:** Enter the path to your Docker Compose file, this path is combined with the Base Directory. Make sure the file extension matches exactly, if it doesn’t then Coolify won’t be able to load it.

Click on **Continue** button once you have set all the above settings to correct details.

## Making services available to the outside world

Read more about [Exposing Services to the Internet](/knowledge-base/docker/compose#exposing-services-to-the-internet) in the Knowledge Base.

## Advanced Configuration

### Using Environment and Shared Variables

Within Coolify you can configure these easily following the details found in the [Knowledge Base for Docker Compose](/knowledge-base/docker/compose#defining-environment-and-shared-variables).

### Storage

You can set up storage in your compose file, with some extra options for Coolify.

#### Create an Empty Directory

Define directories with host binding and inform Coolify to create them:

```yaml
services:
  filebrowser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./srv
        target: /srv
        is_directory: true # Instructs Coolify to create the directory.
```

#### Create a File with Content

Specify a file with predefined content and even include a dynamic value from an environment variable:

```yaml
services:
  filebrowser:
    image: filebrowser/filebrowser:latest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: ./srv/99-roles.sql
        target: /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-scripts/99-roles.sql
        content: |
          -- NOTE: Change these passwords for production!
           \set pgpass `echo "$POSTGRES_PASSWORD"`

           ALTER USER authenticator WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';
           ALTER USER pgbouncer WITH PASSWORD :'pgpass';
```

### Exclude from Healthchecks

If a service should not be part of the overall healthchecks (for example, a one-time migration service), set the `exclude_from_hc` option to `true`:

```yaml
services:
  some-service:
    exclude_from_hc: true
    ...
```

### Connect to Predefined Networks

By default, each compose stack is deployed to a separate network named after your resource UUID. This setup allows each service in the stack to communicate with one another.

If you want to connect services across different stacks (for example, linking an application to a separate database), enable the **Connect to Predefined Network** option on your Service Stack page.

Note that you must use the full name (like `postgres-<uuid>`) when referencing a service in another stack.

### Raw Docker Compose Deployment

For advanced users, Coolify offers a "Raw Compose Deployment" mode. This option lets you deploy your Docker Compose file directly without many of Coolify's additional configurations.

::: danger CAUTION
This mode is intended for advanced users familiar with Docker Compose.

### Labels

Coolify automatically adds these labels to your application (if not already set):

```yaml
labels:
  - coolify.managed=true
  - coolify.applicationId=5
  - coolify.type=application
```

To enable Coolify's Proxy (Traefik), also include these labels:

```yaml
labels:
  - traefik.enable=true
  - "traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.rule=Host(`shadowarcanist.com`) && PathPrefix(`/`)"
  - traefik.http.routers.<unique_router_name>.entryPoints=http
```

### Build Arguments

When building images with Docker Compose, Coolify can inject build arguments into your build process. You can configure these settings in the **Advanced** menu of your application.

#### Inject Build Args to Dockerfile

Controls whether Coolify automatically injects build arguments during the build. Disable this in the Advanced menu if you want full control over build arguments in your Dockerfile.

* **Enabled (default):** Coolify automatically injects build arguments
* **Disabled:** You manage `ARG` statements yourself in the Dockerfile

#### Include Source Commit in Build

Controls whether the `SOURCE_COMMIT` variable (Git commit hash) is included in builds. Disabled by default to preserve Docker's build cache between commits. You can enable this in the Advanced menu if your build process requires the commit hash.

* **Disabled (default):** `SOURCE_COMMIT` is not included, improving cache utilization
* **Enabled:** `SOURCE_COMMIT` is included as a build argument

::: warning Build Cache Optimization
If build cache is not being preserved between deployments, ensure "Include Source Commit in Build" is disabled. The `SOURCE_COMMIT` value changes with every commit and will invalidate the cache.

## Known Issues and Solutions

::: details 1. Visiting the Application Domain Shows "No Available Server"
If you see a "No Available Server" error when visiting your website, it is likely due to the health check for your container.

Run `docker ps` on your server terminal to check if your container is unhealthy or still starting.

To resolve this, fix the issue causing the container to be unhealthy or remove the health checks.
