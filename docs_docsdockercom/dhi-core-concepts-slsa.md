## Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)

Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) is a security framework designed to enhance the integrity and security of software supply chains. Developed by Google and maintained by the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), SLSA provides a set of guidelines and best practices to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure in software projects.

SLSA defines [four build levels (0–3)](https://slsa.dev/spec/latest/build-track-basics) of increasing security rigor, focusing on areas such as build provenance, source integrity, and build environment security. Each level builds upon the previous one, offering a structured approach to achieving higher levels of software supply chain security.

SLSA is crucial for modern software development due to the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of software supply chains. Supply chain attacks, such as the SolarWinds breach, have highlighted the vulnerabilities in software development processes. By implementing SLSA, organizations can:

- Ensure artifact integrity: Verify that software artifacts have not been tampered with during the build and deployment processes.
- Enhance build provenance: Maintain verifiable records of how and when software artifacts were produced, providing transparency and accountability.
- Secure build environments: Implement controls to protect build systems from unauthorized access and modifications.
- Mitigate supply chain risks: Reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities or malicious code into the software supply chain.

SLSA Build Level 3, Hardened Builds, is the highest of four progressive levels in the SLSA framework. It introduces strict requirements to ensure that software artifacts are built securely and traceably. To meet Level 3, a build must:

- Be fully automated and scripted to prevent manual tampering
- Use a trusted build service that enforces source and builder authentication
- Generate a signed, tamper-resistant provenance record describing how the artifact was built
- Capture metadata about the build environment, source repository, and build steps

This level provides strong guarantees that the software was built from the expected source in a controlled, auditable environment, which significantly reduces the risk of supply chain attacks.

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) are secure-by-default container images purpose-built for modern production environments. Each DHI is cryptographically signed and complies with the [SLSA Build Level 3 standard](https://slsa.dev/spec/latest/build-track-basics#build-l3), ensuring verifiable build provenance and integrity.

By integrating SLSA-compliant DHIs into your development and deployment processes, you can:

- Achieve higher security levels: Utilize images that meet stringent security standards, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities and attacks.
- Simplify compliance: Leverage built-in features like signed Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) and vulnerability exception (VEX) statements to facilitate compliance with regulations such as FedRAMP.
- Enhance transparency: Access detailed information about the components and build process of each image, promoting transparency and trust.
- Streamline audits: Utilize verifiable build records and signatures to simplify security audits and assessments.

Each Docker Hardened Image (DHI) is cryptographically signed and includes attestations. These attestations provide verifiable build provenance and demonstrate adherence to SLSA Build Level 3 standards.

To get and verify SLSA provenance for a DHI, you can use Docker Scout.
