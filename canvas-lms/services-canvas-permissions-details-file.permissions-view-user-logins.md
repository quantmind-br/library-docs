Allows user to search for other users by Login ID in the account People page.

### Additional Considerations

To access the People page, Users - view list must be enabled.

If this permission is enabled, and if Users - view primary email address is disabled, users will see email addresses used as login IDs.

To view login IDs, Users - allow administrative actions in courses must also be enabled.
