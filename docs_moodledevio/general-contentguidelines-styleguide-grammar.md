## Structuring content[​](#structuring-content "Direct link to Structuring content")

### Headings[​](#headings "Direct link to Headings")

When writing headings:

- Start with the most relevant keywords where possible
- Be descriptive
- Avoid jargon or clever wordplay
- Use sentence case (sentence case is when the only capital letter is at the start of the heading)
- Don't put a full stop at the end

## Numbers[​](#numbers "Direct link to Numbers")

In general, use numerals instead of words for most numbers. Numerals are easier to scan, especially when users are skimming content.

Write out a number only when:

- It appears at the start of a sentence
- It could be confused for a letter (for example, the numeral '1' might look like an uppercase 'I')

### Number ranges[​](#number-ranges "Direct link to Number ranges")

Always use the word 'to' to express a range of numbers, not a hyphen or dash, so that the sentence is read correctly by a screen reader.

### Dates[​](#dates "Direct link to Dates")

We use the Australian sequence for dates, which is: day, month, year.

However, if you're writing for a specific audience, choose the date format that is most familiar to them.

#### Dates in sentences[​](#dates-in-sentences "Direct link to Dates in sentences")

When writing a date in a sentence, use DD Month YYYY. If a number has only one digit, don't include a leading zero.

#### Numeric dates[​](#numeric-dates "Direct link to Numeric dates")

When writing a date using only numbers, use DD/MM/YYYY. If a number has only one digit, don't include a leading zero.

#### Ordinal numbers[​](#ordinal-numbers "Direct link to Ordinal numbers")

Don't use ordinal numbers in dates.

#### Days of the week[​](#days-of-the-week "Direct link to Days of the week")

If you include the day of the week in a date, add a comma after the day.

### Time and time zones​[​](#time-and-time-zones "Direct link to Time and time zones​")

In general, we use the Australian convention for time:

- Use 'am' for hours from midnight to noon
- Use 'pm' for hours from noon to midnight

However, choose the 12-hour or 24-hour format depending on what's most familiar to your audience.

#### Am and pm[​](#am-and-pm "Direct link to Am and pm")

Write 'am' and 'pm' always in lowercase, with a non-breaking space (&nbsp) before them and with no full stops between the letters.

#### Minutes[​](#minutes "Direct link to Minutes")

For times on the hour, include minutes.

#### Time zones[​](#time-zones "Direct link to Time zones")

If you're writing about a specific time that affects people worldwide (for example, down time for a site or a deadline for a contest), always include the name of the time zone. You can also choose to include more than one time zone.

Do

The contest will close at 4:00 pm AWST / 10:00 am CEST

Don't

The contest will close at 4:00 pm

### Decimal points[​](#decimal-points "Direct link to Decimal points")

To indicate decimal points, use full stops.

Include a leading zero before the decimal point. This helps with readability and reduces ambiguity, especially for screen readers.

### Percentages[​](#percentages "Direct link to Percentages")

With numbers, use '%' instead of the word 'per cent'.

Do

You have completed 89% of the course.

Don't

You have completed 89 per cent of the course.

### Large numbers[​](#large-numbers "Direct link to Large numbers")

Large numbers, such as millions, billions and trillions, are usually easier to read when they are written out as words. When writing out large numbers as words, don't use abbreviations.

If you use the numeric form, include a comma every three digits for readability.

### Currencies and money[​](#currencies-and-money "Direct link to Currencies and money")

Put the currency symbol before the amount, not after it.

Don't use full stops in currency abbreviations.

### Measurement[​](#measurement "Direct link to Measurement")

Use metric as the default measurement system. Use a non-breaking space (&nbsp) between the number and the unit.

## Moodle-specific punctuation and language[​](#moodle-specific-punctuation-and-language "Direct link to Moodle-specific punctuation and language")

### Acronyms[​](#acronyms "Direct link to Acronyms")

Spell out acronyms when you first use them.

For example: *The advantages of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are...*

The exception is extremely common abbreviations where the abbreviated version is used more widely than the longer version, such as URL.

### Ampersands[​](#ampersands "Direct link to Ampersands")

Don't use an ampersand (&) to mean 'and', unless it's used in a brand name.

### Contractions[​](#contractions "Direct link to Contractions")

Use contractions for common phrases, such as 'don't' or 'can't'.

### Commas[​](#commas "Direct link to Commas")

Use the Oxford comma for the penultimate item in a sentence.

Do

This includes user ID, role, and course ID.

Don't

This includes user ID, role and course ID.

### Dashes and hyphens[​](#dashes-and-hyphens "Direct link to Dashes and hyphens")

Use an em dash (—) with spaces before and after to offset an aside.

Don't

### Emails and URLs[​](#emails-and-urls "Direct link to Emails and URLs")

Use lowercase for email addresses and website URLs. Don't include the 'https' part of the URL.

### Emojis[​](#emojis "Direct link to Emojis")

Use emojis sparingly. Don't use multiple emojis. Make sure you're confident in the emoji's meaning, and that it's consistent across cultures. You can check the meaning of emojis on [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org).

### Exclamation marks[​](#exclamation-marks "Direct link to Exclamation marks")

Save exclamation marks for key moments in the user journey, and don't use more than one exclamation mark.

### Sentence case[​](#sentence-case "Direct link to Sentence case")

Use capital letters only at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns. For headings, subheadings and calls to action, we use sentence case and not Title Case.
