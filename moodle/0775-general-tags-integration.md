## [Accessibility checklist](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/peer-review/accessibility-checklist)

This document proposes a checklist for accessibility reviews. Not all aspects of accessibility can be checked automatically, so this checklist is intended to guide reviewers when doing an accessibility check to a patch.

## [Backporting](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/backporting)

Whilst we'd all like all Moodle users to be using our latest and greatest code, there is a balance to strike between improving our software and maintaining stability (both in terms of regressions, but also training and documentation materials). Large amounts of change on the stable branches make the lives difficult for institutions to manage upgrades between point releases.

## [Integration review](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/integration)
