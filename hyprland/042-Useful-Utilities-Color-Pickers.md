Color pickers are useful for quickly grabbing a color of *something* on your screen.

It’s preferred using *hyprwm*’s own solution, which, so far, seems to be the only one that doesn’t suck.

Dead simple to use. Launch, click, and you’re done. Also see [its wiki page](https://wiki.hypr.land/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpicker). [GitHub](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpicker)
