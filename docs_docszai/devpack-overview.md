## <Icon icon="stars" iconType="solid" color="#ffffff" size={36} />   Advantages

* **Access to a Top-Tier Coding Model:** GLM-4.7 delivers state-of-the-art performance in reasoning, coding, and agent capabilities—leading in tool use and complex task execution.
* **Works with Multiple Coding Tools:** Beyond Claude Code, it also supports Cline, OpenCode, and other mainstream coding tools, giving you flexibility across development workflows.
* **Faster, More Reliable Response:** Generate over 55 tokens per second for real-time interaction. No network restrictions, no account bans—just smooth, uninterrupted coding.
* **Generous Usage at a Fair Price:** Get higher call limits than standard plans. Starting at just 3 USD per month, with Pro plans from 15 USD per month designed for high-frequency, complex projects.
* **Expanded Capabilities:** All plans support Vision Understanding, Web Search MCP and Web Reader MCP supporting multimodal analysis and real-time information retrieval.

### Usage Instruction

* **Lite Plan**: Up to \~120 prompts every 5 hours — about 3× the usage quota of the Claude Pro plan.
* **Pro Plan**: Up to \~600 prompts every 5 hours — about 3× the usage quota of the Claude Max (5x) plan.
* **Max Plan**: Up to \~2400 prompts every 5 hours — about 3× the usage quota of the Claude Max (20x) plan.

In terms of token consumption, each prompt typically allows 15–20 model calls, giving a total monthly allowance of tens of billions of tokens — all at only \~1% of standard API pricing, making it extremely cost-effective.

<Tip>
  The above figures are estimates. Actual usage may vary depending on project complexity, codebase size, and whether auto-accept features are enabled.
</Tip>

### Supported Tools

* The plan can only be used within specific coding tools, including Claude Code, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Cline, OpenCode, Crush, Goose and more.
* Once subscribed, GLM-4.7 is automatically available in the supported tools using your plan’s quota—no additional configuration required. If the quota is exhausted, it will automatically reset at the start of the next 5-hour cycle. The system will not consume other resource packs or account balance. Users with a Coding Plan can only use the plan’s quota in supported tools and cannot call the model separately via API.
* API calls are billed separately and do not use the Coding Plan quota. Please refer to the API pricing for details.

### How to Switch Models

Mapping between Claude Code internal model environment variables and GLM models, with the default configuration as follows:

* `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`: `GLM-4.7`
* `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`: `GLM-4.7`
* `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`: `GLM-4.5-Air`

If adjustments are needed, you can directly modify the configuration file (for example, `~/.claude/settings.json` in Claude Code) to switch to GLM-4.5 or other models.
