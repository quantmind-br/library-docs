## 1 · What is **AGENTS.md**?

**AGENTS.md** is a Markdown file that lives in your repository (or home directory) and acts as a *briefing packet* for AI coding agents.

### Why AGENTS.md?

**README.md** files are for humans: quick starts, project descriptions, and contribution guidelines. **AGENTS.md** complements this by containing the extra, sometimes detailed context coding agents need: build steps, tests, and conventions that might clutter a README or aren’t relevant to human contributors. We intentionally kept it separate to:

- Give agents a clear, predictable place for instructions
- Keep READMEs concise and focused on human contributors
- Provide precise, agent-focused guidance that complements existing README and docs

### What it contains:

- Describes how to **build, test, and run** your project
- Explains architectural patterns and conventions
- Lists external services, environment variables, or design docs
- Provides domain-specific vocabulary and code style rules

Agents read AGENTS.md *before* planning any change, giving them the same tribal knowledge senior engineers already carry in their heads.

## 2 · One AGENTS.md works across many agents

Your AGENTS.md file is compatible with a growing ecosystem of AI coding agents and tools, including:

- **Droids** - Factory’s AI coding agents
- **Cursor** - AI-powered code editor
- **Aider** - AI pair programming in your terminal
- **Gemini CLI** - Google’s command-line AI assistant
- **Jules** - Google’s coding assistant
- **Codex** - OpenAI’s code generation model
- **Zed** - AI-enhanced editor
- **Phoenix** - AI development platform
- And many more emerging tools

Rather than introducing another proprietary file format, AGENTS.md uses a standard that works across the entire AI development ecosystem.

## 3 · File locations & discovery hierarchy

Agents look for AGENTS.md in this order (first match wins):

1. `./AGENTS.md` in the **current working directory**
2. The nearest parent directory up to the repo root
3. Any `AGENTS.md` in sub-folders the agent is working inside
4. Personal override: `~/.factory/AGENTS.md`

* * *

## 4 · File structure & syntax

AGENTS.md is plain Markdown; headings provide semantic hints.

```
# Build & Test ← exact commands for compiling and testing

# Architecture Overview ← short description of major modules

# Security ← auth flows, API keys, sensitive data

# Git Workflows ← branching, commit conventions, PR requirements

# Conventions & Patterns ← naming, folder layout, code style
```

Agents recognize:

- **Top-level headings** (`#`) as sections
- **Bullet lists** for commands or rules
- **Inline code** (`` ` ``) for exact commands, filenames, env vars
- **Links** to external docs (GitHub, Figma, Confluence…)

* * *

## 5 · Common sections

Include only what *future you* will care about—brevity beats encyclopaedia-length files.

## 6 · Templates & examples

### Factory-style comprehensive example

```
# MyProject

This is an overview of My Project. It's an example app used to highlight AGENTS.md files utility.

## Core Commands

• Type-check and lint: `pnpm check`
• Auto-fix style: `pnpm check:fix`
• Run full test suite: `pnpm test --run --no-color`
• Run a single test file: `pnpm test --run <path>.test.ts`
• Start dev servers (frontend + backend): `pnpm dev`
• Build for production: `pnpm build` then `pnpm preview`

All other scripts wrap these six tasks.

## Project Layout

├─ client/ → React + Vite frontend
├─ server/ → Express backend

• Frontend code lives **only** in `client/`
• Backend code lives **only** in `server/`
• Shared, environment-agnostic helpers belong in `src/`

## Development Patterns & Constraints

Coding style
• TypeScript strict mode, single quotes, trailing commas, no semicolons.
• 100-char line limit, tabs for indent (2-space YAML/JSON/MD).
• Use interfaces for public APIs; avoid `@ts-ignore`.
• Tests first when fixing logic bugs.
• Visual diff loop for UI tweaks.
• Never introduce new runtime deps without explanation in PR description.

## Git Workflow Essentials

1. Branch from `main` with a descriptive name: `feature/<slug>` or `bugfix/<slug>`.
2. Run `pnpm check` locally **before** committing.
3. Force pushes **allowed only** on your feature branch using
   `git push --force-with-lease`. Never force-push `main`.
4. Keep commits atomic; prefer checkpoints (`feat: …`, `test: …`).

## Evidence Required for Every PR

A pull request is reviewable when it includes:

- All tests green (`pnpm test`)
- Lint & type check pass (`pnpm check`)
- Diff confined to agreed paths (see section 2)
- **Proof artifact**
  • Bug fix → failing test added first, now passes
  • Feature → new tests or visual snapshot demonstrating behavior
- One-paragraph commit / PR description covering intent & root cause
- No drop in coverage, no unexplained runtime deps
```

### Node + React monorepo

```
# Build & Test

- Build: `npm run build`
- Test: `npm run test -- --runInBand`

# Run Locally

- API: `npm run dev --workspace=api`
- Web: `npm run dev --workspace=web`
- Storybook: `npm run storybook`

# Conventions

- All backend code in `packages/api/src`
- React components in `packages/web/src/components`
- Use `zod` for request validation

# Architecture Overview

The API is GraphQL (Apollo). Web uses Next.js with SSR.

# External Services

- Stripe for payments (`STRIPE_KEY`)
- S3 for uploads (`AWS_BUCKET`)

# Gotchas

- Test snapshot paths are absolute—run `npm run test -- --updateSnapshot` after refactors.
```

### Python microservice

```
# Build & Test

- Build: `pip install -e .`
- Test: `pytest`

# Run Locally

- `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

# Conventions

- Config via Pydantic settings (`settings.py`)
- CELERY tasks live in `tasks/`
```

## 8 · How agents use AGENTS.md

## 9 · When things go wrong

Like any development work, agent tasks sometimes need course correction when scope creeps or assumptions prove wrong. The same iteration patterns that work with human collaborators apply here.

### Warning signs of agent drift:

- Plans that rewrite themselves mid-execution
- Edits outside the declared paths
- Fixes claimed without failing tests to prove they work
- Diffs bloated with unrelated changes

### Recovery playbook:

1. **Tighten the spec**: Narrow the directory or tests the agent may touch
2. **Salvage the good**: Keep valid artifacts such as a failing test; revert noisy edits
3. **Restart clean**: Launch a fresh session with improved instructions
4. **Take over**: When you can tell the agent is failing, pair program the final changes

## 10 · Getting started

### Summary

1. Add **AGENTS.md** at your repo root (and optionally submodules).
2. Document build/test commands, conventions, and gotchas—*concise & actionable*.
3. Agents read it automatically; no extra flags required.

Pick one modest bug or small feature from your backlog. Write three clear sentences that state where to begin, how to reproduce the issue, and what proof signals completion. Run the agent through Explore → Plan → Code → Verify, review the evidence, and merge. Ship faster with fewer surprises—give your agent the playbook it needs!
