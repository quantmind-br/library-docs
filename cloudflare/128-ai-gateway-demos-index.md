Learn how you can use AI Gateway within your existing architecture.

## Reference architectures

Explore the following reference architectures that use AI Gateway:

[Fullstack applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[A practical example of how these services come together in a real fullstack application architecture.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[Multi-vendor AI observability and control](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/)

[By shifting features such as rate limiting, caching, and error handling to the proxy layer, organizations can apply unified configurations across services and inference service providers.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-multivendor-observability-control/)

[AI Vibe Coding Platform](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-vibe-coding-platform/)

[Cloudflare's low-latency, fully serverless compute platform, Workers offers powerful capabilities to enable A/B testing using a server-side implementation.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-vibe-coding-platform/)
