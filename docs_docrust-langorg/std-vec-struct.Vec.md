## Struct Vec

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#438)

```rust
pub struct Vec<T, A = Global>
where
    A: Allocator,{ /* private fields */ }
```

Expand description

A contiguous growable array type, written as `Vec<T>`, short for ‘vector’.

## [§](#examples)Examples

```rust
let mut vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(1);
vec.push(2);

assert_eq!(vec.len(), 2);
assert_eq!(vec[0], 1);

assert_eq!(vec.pop(), Some(2));
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 1);

vec[0] = 7;
assert_eq!(vec[0], 7);

vec.extend([1, 2, 3]);

for x in &vec {
    println!("{x}");
}
assert_eq!(vec, [7, 1, 2, 3]);
```

The [`vec!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.vec.html "macro std::vec") macro is provided for convenient initialization:

```rust
let mut vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
vec1.push(4);
let vec2 = Vec::from([1, 2, 3, 4]);
assert_eq!(vec1, vec2);
```

It can also initialize each element of a `Vec<T>` with a given value. This may be more efficient than performing allocation and initialization in separate steps, especially when initializing a vector of zeros:

```rust
let vec = vec![0; 5];
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);

// The following is equivalent, but potentially slower:
let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(5);
vec.resize(5, 0);
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
```

For more information, see [Capacity and Reallocation](#capacity-and-reallocation).

Use a `Vec<T>` as an efficient stack:

```rust
let mut stack = Vec::new();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);

while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
    // Prints 3, 2, 1
    println!("{top}");
}
```

## [§](#indexing)Indexing

The `Vec` type allows access to values by index, because it implements the [`Index`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Index.html "trait std::ops::Index") trait. An example will be more explicit:

```rust
let v = vec![0, 2, 4, 6];
println!("{}", v[1]); // it will display '2'
```

However be careful: if you try to access an index which isn’t in the `Vec`, your software will panic! You cannot do this:

[ⓘ](# "This example panics")

```rust
let v = vec![0, 2, 4, 6];
println!("{}", v[6]); // it will panic!
```

Use [`get`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get "method slice::get") and [`get_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.get_mut "method slice::get_mut") if you want to check whether the index is in the `Vec`.

## [§](#slicing)Slicing

A `Vec` can be mutable. On the other hand, slices are read-only objects. To get a [slice](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html "primitive slice"), use [`&`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference"). Example:

```rust
fn read_slice(slice: &[usize]) {
    // ...
}

let v = vec![0, 1];
read_slice(&v);

// ... and that's all!
// you can also do it like this:
let u: &[usize] = &v;
// or like this:
let u: &[_] = &v;
```

In Rust, it’s more common to pass slices as arguments rather than vectors when you just want to provide read access. The same goes for [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html "struct std::string::String") and [`&str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.str.html "primitive str").

## [§](#capacity-and-reallocation)Capacity and reallocation

The capacity of a vector is the amount of space allocated for any future elements that will be added onto the vector. This is not to be confused with the *length* of a vector, which specifies the number of actual elements within the vector. If a vector’s length exceeds its capacity, its capacity will automatically be increased, but its elements will have to be reallocated.

For example, a vector with capacity 10 and length 0 would be an empty vector with space for 10 more elements. Pushing 10 or fewer elements onto the vector will not change its capacity or cause reallocation to occur. However, if the vector’s length is increased to 11, it will have to reallocate, which can be slow. For this reason, it is recommended to use [`Vec::with_capacity`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.with_capacity "associated function std::vec::Vec::with_capacity") whenever possible to specify how big the vector is expected to get.

## [§](#guarantees)Guarantees

Due to its incredibly fundamental nature, `Vec` makes a lot of guarantees about its design. This ensures that it’s as low-overhead as possible in the general case, and can be correctly manipulated in primitive ways by unsafe code. Note that these guarantees refer to an unqualified `Vec<T>`. If additional type parameters are added (e.g., to support custom allocators), overriding their defaults may change the behavior.

Most fundamentally, `Vec` is and always will be a (pointer, capacity, length) triplet. No more, no less. The order of these fields is completely unspecified, and you should use the appropriate methods to modify these. The pointer will never be null, so this type is null-pointer-optimized.

However, the pointer might not actually point to allocated memory. In particular, if you construct a `Vec` with capacity 0 via [`Vec::new`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.new "associated function std::vec::Vec::new"), [`vec![]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.vec.html "macro std::vec"), [`Vec::with_capacity(0)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.with_capacity "associated function std::vec::Vec::with_capacity"), or by calling [`shrink_to_fit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to_fit "method std::vec::Vec::shrink_to_fit") on an empty Vec, it will not allocate memory. Similarly, if you store zero-sized types inside a `Vec`, it will not allocate space for them. *Note that in this case the `Vec` might not report a [`capacity`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.capacity "method std::vec::Vec::capacity") of 0*. `Vec` will allocate if and only if `size_of::<T>() * capacity() > 0`. In general, `Vec`’s allocation details are very subtle — if you intend to allocate memory using a `Vec` and use it for something else (either to pass to unsafe code, or to build your own memory-backed collection), be sure to deallocate this memory by using `from_raw_parts` to recover the `Vec` and then dropping it.

If a `Vec` *has* allocated memory, then the memory it points to is on the heap (as defined by the allocator Rust is configured to use by default), and its pointer points to [`len`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.len "method std::vec::Vec::len") initialized, contiguous elements in order (what you would see if you coerced it to a slice), followed by `capacity - len` logically uninitialized, contiguous elements.

A vector containing the elements `'a'` and `'b'` with capacity 4 can be visualized as below. The top part is the `Vec` struct, it contains a pointer to the head of the allocation in the heap, length and capacity. The bottom part is the allocation on the heap, a contiguous memory block.

```text
            ptr      len  capacity
       +--------+--------+--------+
       | 0x0123 |      2 |      4 |
       +--------+--------+--------+
            |
            v
Heap   +--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |    'a' |    'b' | uninit | uninit |
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+
```

- **uninit** represents memory that is not initialized, see [`MaybeUninit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html "union std::mem::MaybeUninit").
- Note: the ABI is not stable and `Vec` makes no guarantees about its memory layout (including the order of fields).

`Vec` will never perform a “small optimization” where elements are actually stored on the stack for two reasons:

- It would make it more difficult for unsafe code to correctly manipulate a `Vec`. The contents of a `Vec` wouldn’t have a stable address if it were only moved, and it would be more difficult to determine if a `Vec` had actually allocated memory.
- It would penalize the general case, incurring an additional branch on every access.

`Vec` will never automatically shrink itself, even if completely empty. This ensures no unnecessary allocations or deallocations occur. Emptying a `Vec` and then filling it back up to the same [`len`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.len "method std::vec::Vec::len") should incur no calls to the allocator. If you wish to free up unused memory, use [`shrink_to_fit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to_fit "method std::vec::Vec::shrink_to_fit") or [`shrink_to`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to "method std::vec::Vec::shrink_to").

[`push`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.push "method std::vec::Vec::push") and [`insert`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.insert "method std::vec::Vec::insert") will never (re)allocate if the reported capacity is sufficient. [`push`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.push "method std::vec::Vec::push") and [`insert`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.insert "method std::vec::Vec::insert") *will* (re)allocate if `len == capacity`. That is, the reported capacity is completely accurate, and can be relied on. It can even be used to manually free the memory allocated by a `Vec` if desired. Bulk insertion methods *may* reallocate, even when not necessary.

`Vec` does not guarantee any particular growth strategy when reallocating when full, nor when [`reserve`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.reserve "method std::vec::Vec::reserve") is called. The current strategy is basic and it may prove desirable to use a non-constant growth factor. Whatever strategy is used will of course guarantee *O*(1) amortized [`push`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.push "method std::vec::Vec::push").

It is guaranteed, in order to respect the intentions of the programmer, that all of `vec![e_1, e_2, ..., e_n]`, `vec![x; n]`, and [`Vec::with_capacity(n)`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.with_capacity "associated function std::vec::Vec::with_capacity") produce a `Vec` that requests an allocation of the exact size needed for precisely `n` elements from the allocator, and no other size (such as, for example: a size rounded up to the nearest power of 2). The allocator will return an allocation that is at least as large as requested, but it may be larger.

It is guaranteed that the [`Vec::capacity`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.capacity "method std::vec::Vec::capacity") method returns a value that is at least the requested capacity and not more than the allocated capacity.

The method [`Vec::shrink_to_fit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to_fit "method std::vec::Vec::shrink_to_fit") will attempt to discard excess capacity an allocator has given to a `Vec`. If `len == capacity`, then a `Vec<T>` can be converted to and from a [`Box<[T]>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html "struct std::boxed::Box") without reallocating or moving the elements. `Vec` exploits this fact as much as reasonable when implementing common conversions such as [`into_boxed_slice`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.into_boxed_slice "method std::vec::Vec::into_boxed_slice").

`Vec` will not specifically overwrite any data that is removed from it, but also won’t specifically preserve it. Its uninitialized memory is scratch space that it may use however it wants. It will generally just do whatever is most efficient or otherwise easy to implement. Do not rely on removed data to be erased for security purposes. Even if you drop a `Vec`, its buffer may simply be reused by another allocation. Even if you zero a `Vec`’s memory first, that might not actually happen because the optimizer does not consider this a side-effect that must be preserved. There is one case which we will not break, however: using `unsafe` code to write to the excess capacity, and then increasing the length to match, is always valid.

Currently, `Vec` does not guarantee the order in which elements are dropped. The order has changed in the past and may change again.

1.0.0 (const: 1.39.0) · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#463)

Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T>`.

The vector will not allocate until elements are pushed onto it.

##### [§](#examples-1)Examples

```rust
let mut vec: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

1.0.0 (const: [unstable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/79597 "Tracking issue for const_heap")) · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#523)

Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T>` with at least the specified capacity.

The vector will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than `capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the vector will not allocate.

It is important to note that although the returned vector has the minimum *capacity* specified, the vector will have a zero *length*. For an explanation of the difference between length and capacity, see [*Capacity and reallocation*](#capacity-and-reallocation).

If it is important to know the exact allocated capacity of a `Vec`, always use the [`capacity`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.capacity "method std::vec::Vec::capacity") method after construction.

For `Vec<T>` where `T` is a zero-sized type, there will be no allocation and the capacity will always be `usize::MAX`.

##### [§](#panics)Panics

Panics if the new capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` *bytes*.

##### [§](#examples-2)Examples

```rust
let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(10);

// The vector contains no items, even though it has capacity for more
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 0);
assert!(vec.capacity() >= 10);

// These are all done without reallocating...
for i in 0..10 {
    vec.push(i);
}
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 10);
assert!(vec.capacity() >= 10);

// ...but this may make the vector reallocate
vec.push(11);
assert_eq!(vec.len(), 11);
assert!(vec.capacity() >= 11);

// A vector of a zero-sized type will always over-allocate, since no
// allocation is necessary
let vec_units = Vec::<()>::with_capacity(10);
assert_eq!(vec_units.capacity(), usize::MAX);
```

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`try_with_capacity` [#91913](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/91913))

Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T>` with at least the specified capacity.

The vector will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than `capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the vector will not allocate.

##### [§](#errors)Errors

Returns an error if the capacity exceeds `isize::MAX` *bytes*, or if the allocator reports allocation failure.

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#643)

Creates a `Vec<T>` directly from a pointer, a length, and a capacity.

##### [§](#safety)Safety

This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren’t checked:

- If `T` is not a zero-sized type and the capacity is nonzero, `ptr` must have been allocated using the global allocator, such as via the [`alloc::alloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/fn.alloc.html "fn std::alloc::alloc") function. If `T` is a zero-sized type or the capacity is zero, `ptr` need only be non-null and aligned.
- `T` needs to have the same alignment as what `ptr` was allocated with, if the pointer is required to be allocated. (`T` having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really needs to be equal to satisfy the [`dealloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html#tymethod.dealloc "method std::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc") requirement that memory must be allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
- The size of `T` times the `capacity` (ie. the allocated size in bytes), if nonzero, needs to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because similar to alignment, [`dealloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html#tymethod.dealloc "method std::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc") must be called with the same layout `size`.)
- `length` needs to be less than or equal to `capacity`.
- The first `length` values must be properly initialized values of type `T`.
- `capacity` needs to be the capacity that the pointer was allocated with, if the pointer is required to be allocated.
- The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than `isize::MAX`. See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset "method pointer::offset").

These requirements are always upheld by any `ptr` that has been allocated via `Vec<T>`. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are upheld.

Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator’s internal data structures. For example it is normally **not** safe to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length `size_t`, doing so is only safe if the array was initially allocated by a `Vec` or `String`. It’s also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length, because the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for `u16`), but after turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it’ll be deallocated with alignment 1. To avoid these issues, it is often preferable to do casting/transmuting using [`slice::from_raw_parts`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/slice/fn.from_raw_parts.html "fn std::slice::from_raw_parts") instead.

The ownership of `ptr` is effectively transferred to the `Vec<T>` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this function.

##### [§](#examples-3)Examples

```rust
use std::ptr;

let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

// Deconstruct the vector into parts.
let (p, len, cap) = v.into_raw_parts();

unsafe {
    // Overwrite memory with 4, 5, 6
    for i in 0..len {
        ptr::write(p.add(i), 4 + i);
    }

    // Put everything back together into a Vec
    let rebuilt = Vec::from_raw_parts(p, len, cap);
    assert_eq!(rebuilt, [4, 5, 6]);
}
```

Using memory that was allocated elsewhere:

```rust
use std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};

fn main() {
    let layout = Layout::array::<u32>(16).expect("overflow cannot happen");

        let mem = alloc(layout).cast::<u32>();
        if mem.is_null() {
            return;
        }

        mem.write(1_000_000);

        Vec::from_raw_parts(mem, 1, 16)
    };

    assert_eq!(vec, &[1_000_000]);

[Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#795-797)

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`vec_from_fn` [#149698](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/149698))

Creates a `Vec<T>` where each element is produced by calling `f` with that element’s index while walking forward through the `Vec<T>`.

This is essentially the same as writing

```text
vec![f(0), f(1), f(2), …, f(length - 2), f(length - 1)]
```

and is similar to `(0..i).map(f)`, just for `Vec<T>`s not iterators.

If `length == 0`, this produces an empty `Vec<T>` without ever calling `f`.

##### [§](#example)Example

```rust
#![feature(vec_from_fn)]

let vec = Vec::from_fn(5, |i| i);

// indexes are:  0  1  2  3  4
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]);

let vec2 = Vec::from_fn(8, |i| i * 2);

// indexes are:   0  1  2  3  4  5   6   7
assert_eq!(vec2, [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]);

let bool_vec = Vec::from_fn(5, |i| i % 2 == 0);

// indexes are:       0     1      2     3      4
assert_eq!(bool_vec, [true, false, true, false, true]);
```

The `Vec<T>` is generated in ascending index order, starting from the front and going towards the back, so you can use closures with mutable state:

```rust
#![feature(vec_from_fn)]

let mut state = 1;
let a = Vec::from_fn(6, |_| { let x = state; state *= 2; x });

assert_eq!(a, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]);
```

1.93.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#839)

Decomposes a `Vec<T>` into its raw components: `(pointer, length, capacity)`.

Returns the raw pointer to the underlying data, the length of the vector (in elements), and the allocated capacity of the data (in elements).

After calling this function, the caller is responsible for the memory previously managed by the `Vec`.

Constructs a new, empty `Vec<T, A>` with at least the specified capacity with the provided allocator.

The vector will be able to hold at least `capacity` elements without reallocating. This method is allowed to allocate for more elements than `capacity`. If `capacity` is zero, the vector will not allocate.

It is important to note that although the returned vector has the minimum *capacity* specified, the vector will have a zero *length*. For an explanation of the difference between length and capacity, see [*Capacity and reallocation*](#capacity-and-reallocation).

If it is important to know the exact allocated capacity of a `Vec`, always use the [`capacity`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.capacity "method std::vec::Vec::capacity") method after construction.

For `Vec<T, A>` where `T` is a zero-sized type, there will be no allocation and the capacity will always be `usize::MAX`.

Creates a `Vec<T, A>` directly from a pointer, a length, a capacity, and an allocator.

##### [§](#safety-2)Safety

This is highly unsafe, due to the number of invariants that aren’t checked:

- `ptr` must be [*currently allocated*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.Allocator.html#currently-allocated-memory "trait std::alloc::Allocator") via the given allocator `alloc`.
- `T` needs to have the same alignment as what `ptr` was allocated with. (`T` having a less strict alignment is not sufficient, the alignment really needs to be equal to satisfy the [`dealloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html#tymethod.dealloc "method std::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc") requirement that memory must be allocated and deallocated with the same layout.)
- The size of `T` times the `capacity` (ie. the allocated size in bytes) needs to be the same size as the pointer was allocated with. (Because similar to alignment, [`dealloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html#tymethod.dealloc "method std::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc") must be called with the same layout `size`.)
- `length` needs to be less than or equal to `capacity`.
- The first `length` values must be properly initialized values of type `T`.
- `capacity` needs to [*fit*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.Allocator.html#memory-fitting "trait std::alloc::Allocator") the layout size that the pointer was allocated with.
- The allocated size in bytes must be no larger than `isize::MAX`. See the safety documentation of [`pointer::offset`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.pointer.html#method.offset "method pointer::offset").

These requirements are always upheld by any `ptr` that has been allocated via `Vec<T, A>`. Other allocation sources are allowed if the invariants are upheld.

Violating these may cause problems like corrupting the allocator’s internal data structures. For example it is **not** safe to build a `Vec<u8>` from a pointer to a C `char` array with length `size_t`. It’s also not safe to build one from a `Vec<u16>` and its length, because the allocator cares about the alignment, and these two types have different alignments. The buffer was allocated with alignment 2 (for `u16`), but after turning it into a `Vec<u8>` it’ll be deallocated with alignment 1.

The ownership of `ptr` is effectively transferred to the `Vec<T>` which may then deallocate, reallocate or change the contents of memory pointed to by the pointer at will. Ensure that nothing else uses the pointer after calling this function.

Tries to shrink the capacity of the vector as much as possible

The behavior of this method depends on the allocator, which may either shrink the vector in-place or reallocate. The resulting vector might still have some excess capacity, just as is the case for [`with_capacity`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.with_capacity "associated function std::vec::Vec::with_capacity"). See [`Allocator::shrink`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.Allocator.html#method.shrink "method std::alloc::Allocator::shrink") for more details.

##### [§](#errors-4)Errors

This function returns an error if the allocator fails to shrink the allocation, the vector thereafter is still safe to use, the capacity remains unchanged however.

Shortens the vector, keeping the first `len` elements and dropping the rest.

If `len` is greater or equal to the vector’s current length, this has no effect.

The [`drain`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.drain "method std::vec::Vec::drain") method can emulate `truncate`, but causes the excess elements to be returned instead of dropped.

Note that this method has no effect on the allocated capacity of the vector.

Returns a raw pointer to the vector’s buffer, or a dangling raw pointer valid for zero sized reads if the vector didn’t allocate.

The caller must ensure that the vector outlives the pointer this function returns, or else it will end up dangling. Modifying the vector may cause its buffer to be reallocated, which would also make any pointers to it invalid.

The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to is never written to (except inside an `UnsafeCell`) using this pointer or any pointer derived from it. If you need to mutate the contents of the slice, use [`as_mut_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_mut_ptr "method std::vec::Vec::as_mut_ptr").

This method guarantees that for the purpose of the aliasing model, this method does not materialize a reference to the underlying slice, and thus the returned pointer will remain valid when mixed with other calls to [`as_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_ptr "method std::vec::Vec::as_ptr"), [`as_mut_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_mut_ptr "method std::vec::Vec::as_mut_ptr"), and [`as_non_null`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_non_null "method std::vec::Vec::as_non_null"). Note that calling other methods that materialize mutable references to the slice, or mutable references to specific elements you are planning on accessing through this pointer, as well as writing to those elements, may still invalidate this pointer. See the second example below for how this guarantee can be used.

##### [§](#examples-28)Examples

```rust
let x = vec![1, 2, 4];
let x_ptr = x.as_ptr();

unsafe {
    for i in 0..x.len() {
        assert_eq!(*x_ptr.add(i), 1 << i);
    }
}
```

Due to the aliasing guarantee, the following code is legal:

```rust
unsafe {
    let mut v = vec![0, 1, 2];
    let ptr1 = v.as_ptr();
    let _ = ptr1.read();
    let ptr2 = v.as_mut_ptr().offset(2);
    ptr2.write(2);
    // Notably, the write to `ptr2` did *not* invalidate `ptr1`
    // because it mutated a different element:
    let _ = ptr1.read();
}
```

Returns a raw mutable pointer to the vector’s buffer, or a dangling raw pointer valid for zero sized reads if the vector didn’t allocate.

The caller must ensure that the vector outlives the pointer this function returns, or else it will end up dangling. Modifying the vector may cause its buffer to be reallocated, which would also make any pointers to it invalid.

This method guarantees that for the purpose of the aliasing model, this method does not materialize a reference to the underlying slice, and thus the returned pointer will remain valid when mixed with other calls to [`as_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_ptr "method std::vec::Vec::as_ptr"), [`as_mut_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_mut_ptr "method std::vec::Vec::as_mut_ptr"), and [`as_non_null`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.as_non_null "method std::vec::Vec::as_non_null"). Note that calling other methods that materialize references to the slice, or references to specific elements you are planning on accessing through this pointer, may still invalidate this pointer. See the second example below for how this guarantee can be used.

The method also guarantees that, as long as `T` is not zero-sized and the capacity is nonzero, the pointer may be passed into [`dealloc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/alloc/trait.GlobalAlloc.html#tymethod.dealloc "method std::alloc::GlobalAlloc::dealloc") with a layout of `Layout::array::<T>(capacity)` in order to deallocate the backing memory. If this is done, be careful not to run the destructor of the `Vec`, as dropping it will result in double-frees. Wrapping the `Vec` in a [`ManuallyDrop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/struct.ManuallyDrop.html "struct std::mem::ManuallyDrop") is the typical way to achieve this.

##### [§](#examples-29)Examples

    }
    x.set_len(size);
}
assert_eq!(&*x, &[0, 1, 2, 3]);
```

Due to the aliasing guarantee, the following code is legal:

```rust
unsafe {
    let mut v = vec![0];
    let ptr1 = v.as_mut_ptr();
    ptr1.write(1);

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#2161)

Forces the length of the vector to `new_len`.

This is a low-level operation that maintains none of the normal invariants of the type. Normally changing the length of a vector is done using one of the safe operations instead, such as [`truncate`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.truncate "method std::vec::Vec::truncate"), [`resize`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.resize "method std::vec::Vec::resize"), [`extend`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Extend.html#tymethod.extend "method std::iter::Extend::extend"), or [`clear`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.clear "method std::vec::Vec::clear").

##### [§](#safety-4)Safety

- `new_len` must be less than or equal to [`capacity()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.capacity "method std::vec::Vec::capacity").
- The elements at `old_len..new_len` must be initialized.

##### [§](#examples-31)Examples

See [`spare_capacity_mut()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.spare_capacity_mut "method std::vec::Vec::spare_capacity_mut") for an example with safe initialization of capacity elements and use of this method.

`set_len()` can be useful for situations in which the vector is serving as a buffer for other code, particularly over FFI:

```rust
pub fn get_dictionary(&self) -> Option<Vec<u8>> {
    // Per the FFI method's docs, "32768 bytes is always enough".
    let mut dict = Vec::with_capacity(32_768);
    let mut dict_length = 0;
    // SAFETY: When `deflateGetDictionary` returns `Z_OK`, it holds that:
    // 1. `dict_length` elements were initialized.
    // 2. `dict_length` <= the capacity (32_768)
    // which makes `set_len` safe to call.
    unsafe {
        // Make the FFI call...
        let r = deflateGetDictionary(self.strm, dict.as_mut_ptr(), &mut dict_length);
        if r == Z_OK {
            // ...and update the length to what was initialized.
            dict.set_len(dict_length);
            Some(dict)
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
}
```

While the following example is sound, there is a memory leak since the inner vectors were not freed prior to the `set_len` call:

```rust
let mut vec = vec![vec![1, 0, 0],
                   vec![0, 1, 0],
                   vec![0, 0, 1]];
// SAFETY:
// 1. `old_len..0` is empty so no elements need to be initialized.
// 2. `0 <= capacity` always holds whatever `capacity` is.
unsafe {
    vec.set_len(0);
}
```

Normally, here, one would use [`clear`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.clear "method std::vec::Vec::clear") instead to correctly drop the contents and thus not leak memory.

Removes the subslice indicated by the given range from the vector, returning a double-ended iterator over the removed subslice.

If the iterator is dropped before being fully consumed, it drops the remaining removed elements.

The returned iterator keeps a mutable borrow on the vector to optimize its implementation.

Resizes the `Vec` in-place so that `len` is equal to `new_len`.

If `new_len` is greater than `len`, the `Vec` is extended by the difference, with each additional slot filled with the result of calling the closure `f`. The return values from `f` will end up in the `Vec` in the order they have been generated.

If `new_len` is less than `len`, the `Vec` is simply truncated.

This method uses a closure to create new values on every push. If you’d rather [`Clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html "trait std::clone::Clone") a given value, use [`Vec::resize`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.resize "method std::vec::Vec::resize"). If you want to use the [`Default`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html "trait std::default::Default") trait to generate values, you can pass [`Default::default`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/default/trait.Default.html#tymethod.default "associated function std::default::Default::default") as the second argument.

1.47.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/vec/mod.rs.html#3157-3159)

Consumes and leaks the `Vec`, returning a mutable reference to the contents, `&'a mut [T]`.

Note that the type `T` must outlive the chosen lifetime `'a`. If the type has only static references, or none at all, then this may be chosen to be `'static`.

As of Rust 1.57, this method does not reallocate or shrink the `Vec`, so the leaked allocation may include unused capacity that is not part of the returned slice.

This function is mainly useful for data that lives for the remainder of the program’s life. Dropping the returned reference will cause a memory leak.

Groups every `N` elements in the `Vec<T>` into chunks to produce a `Vec<[T; N]>`, dropping elements in the remainder. `N` must be greater than zero.

If the capacity is not a multiple of the chunk size, the buffer will shrink down to the nearest multiple with a reallocation or deallocation.

The `Recyclable` bound prevents this method from being called when `T` and `U` have different sizes; e.g.:

[ⓘ](# "This example deliberately fails to compile")

However, due to temporary implementation limitations of `Recyclable`, this method is not yet callable when `T` or `U` are slices, trait objects, or other exotic types; e.g.:

Creates a splicing iterator that replaces the specified range in the vector with the given `replace_with` iterator and yields the removed items. `replace_with` does not need to be the same length as `range`.

`range` is removed even if the `Splice` iterator is not consumed before it is dropped.

It is unspecified how many elements are removed from the vector if the `Splice` value is leaked.

The input iterator `replace_with` is only consumed when the `Splice` value is dropped.

This is optimal if:

- The tail (elements in the vector after `range`) is empty,
- or `replace_with` yields fewer or equal elements than `range`’s length
- or the lower bound of its `size_hint()` is exact.

Otherwise, a temporary vector is allocated and the tail is moved twice.

##### [§](#panics-18)Panics

Panics if the range has `start_bound > end_bound`, or, if the range is bounded on either end and past the length of the vector.

##### [§](#examples-62)Examples

let new = [7, 8, 9];
let u: Vec<_> = v.splice(1..3, new).collect();
assert_eq!(v, [1, 7, 8, 9, 4]);
assert_eq!(u, [2, 3]);
```

Using `splice` to insert new items into a vector efficiently at a specific position indicated by an empty range:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 5];
let new = [2, 3, 4];
v.splice(1..1, new);
assert_eq!(v, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

Creates an iterator which uses a closure to determine if an element in the range should be removed.

If the closure returns `true`, the element is removed from the vector and yielded. If the closure returns `false`, or panics, the element remains in the vector and will not be yielded.

Only elements that fall in the provided range are considered for extraction, but any elements after the range will still have to be moved if any element has been extracted.

If the returned `ExtractIf` is not exhausted, e.g. because it is dropped without iterating or the iteration short-circuits, then the remaining elements will be retained. Use `extract_if().for_each(drop)` if you do not need the returned iterator, or [`retain_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.retain_mut "method std::vec::Vec::retain_mut") with a negated predicate if you also do not need to restrict the range.

Using this method is equivalent to the following code:

```rust
let mut i = range.start;
let end_items = vec.len() - range.end;

while i < vec.len() - end_items {
    if some_predicate(&mut vec[i]) {
        let val = vec.remove(i);
        // your code here
    } else {
        i += 1;
    }
}
```

But `extract_if` is easier to use. `extract_if` is also more efficient, because it can backshift the elements of the array in bulk.

The iterator also lets you mutate the value of each element in the closure, regardless of whether you choose to keep or remove it.

Returns a raw pointer to the slice’s buffer.

The caller must ensure that the slice outlives the pointer this function returns, or else it will end up dangling.

The caller must also ensure that the memory the pointer (non-transitively) points to is never written to (except inside an `UnsafeCell`) using this pointer or any pointer derived from it.

1.48.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/slice/mod.rs.html#793)

Returns the two raw pointers spanning the slice.

The returned range is half-open, which means that the end pointer points *one past* the last element of the slice. This way, an empty slice is represented by two equal pointers, and the difference between the two pointers represents the size of the slice.

See [`as_ptr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.as_ptr "method slice::as_ptr") for warnings on using these pointers. The end pointer requires extra caution, as it does not point to a valid element in the slice.

This function is useful for interacting with foreign interfaces which use two pointers to refer to a range of elements in memory, as is common in C++.

It can also be useful to check if a pointer to an element refers to an element of this slice:

```rust
let a = [1, 2, 3];
let x = &a[1] as *const _;
let y = &5 as *const _;

Due to each chunk having exactly `chunk_size` elements, the compiler can often optimize the resulting code better than in the case of [`chunks`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks "method slice::chunks").

See [`chunks`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks "method slice::chunks") for a variant of this iterator that also returns the remainder as a smaller chunk, and [`rchunks_exact`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.rchunks_exact "method slice::rchunks_exact") for the same iterator but starting at the end of the slice.

If your `chunk_size` is a constant, consider using [`as_chunks`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.as_chunks "method slice::as_chunks") instead, which will give references to arrays of exactly that length, rather than slices.

Splits the slice into a slice of `N`-element arrays, starting at the beginning of the slice, and a remainder slice with length strictly less than `N`.

The remainder is meaningful in the division sense. Given `let (chunks, remainder) = slice.as_chunks()`, then:

- `chunks.len()` equals `slice.len() / N`,
- `remainder.len()` equals `slice.len() % N`, and
- `slice.len()` equals `chunks.len() * N + remainder.len()`.

Divides one mutable slice into two at an index, without doing bounds checking.

The first will contain all indices from `[0, mid)` (excluding the index `mid` itself) and the second will contain all indices from `[mid, len)` (excluding the index `len` itself).

For a safe alternative see [`split_at_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.split_at_mut "method slice::split_at_mut").

##### [§](#safety-11)Safety

Calling this method with an out-of-bounds index is [*undefined behavior*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html) even if the resulting reference is not used. The caller has to ensure that `0 <= mid <= self.len()`.

##### [§](#examples-114)Examples

```rust
let mut v = [1, 0, 3, 0, 5, 6];
// scoped to restrict the lifetime of the borrows
unsafe {
    let (left, right) = v.split_at_mut_unchecked(2);
    assert_eq!(left, [1, 0]);
    assert_eq!(right, [3, 0, 5, 6]);
    left[1] = 2;
    right[1] = 4;
}
assert_eq!(v, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]);
```

Divides one slice into two at an index, returning `None` if the slice is too short.

If `mid ≤ len` returns a pair of slices where the first will contain all indices from `[0, mid)` (excluding the index `mid` itself) and the second will contain all indices from `[mid, len)` (excluding the index `len` itself).

Otherwise, if `mid > len`, returns `None`.

Returns an iterator over subslices separated by elements that match `pred`. The matched element is not contained in the subslices.

##### [§](#examples-117)Examples

```rust
let slice = [10, 40, 33, 20];
let mut iter = slice.split(|num| num % 3 == 0);

assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[10, 40]);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[20]);
assert!(iter.next().is_none());
```

If the first element is matched, an empty slice will be the first item returned by the iterator. Similarly, if the last element in the slice is matched, an empty slice will be the last item returned by the iterator:

```rust
let slice = [10, 40, 33];
let mut iter = slice.split(|num| num % 3 == 0);

assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[10, 40]);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[]);
assert!(iter.next().is_none());
```

If two matched elements are directly adjacent, an empty slice will be present between them:

```rust
let slice = [10, 6, 33, 20];
let mut iter = slice.split(|num| num % 3 == 0);

assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[10]);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[]);
assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[20]);

assert_eq!(iter.next().unwrap(), &[20]);
assert!(iter.next().is_none());
```

If the last element of the slice is matched, that element will be considered the terminator of the preceding slice. That slice will be the last item returned by the iterator.

```rust
let slice = [3, 10, 40, 33];
let mut iter = slice.split_inclusive(|num| num % 3 == 0);

```

As with `split()`, if the first or last element is matched, an empty slice will be the first (or last) item returned by the iterator.

```rust
let v = &[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8];
let mut it = v.rsplit(|n| *n % 2 == 0);

Binary searches this slice for a given element. If the slice is not sorted, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless.

If the value is found then [`Result::Ok`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#variant.Ok "variant std::result::Result::Ok") is returned, containing the index of the matching element. If there are multiple matches, then any one of the matches could be returned. The index is chosen deterministically, but is subject to change in future versions of Rust. If the value is not found then [`Result::Err`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#variant.Err "variant std::result::Result::Err") is returned, containing the index where a matching element could be inserted while maintaining sorted order.

See also [`binary_search_by`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.binary_search_by "method slice::binary_search_by"), [`binary_search_by_key`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.binary_search_by_key "method slice::binary_search_by_key"), and [`partition_point`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.partition_point "method slice::partition_point").

Looks up a series of four elements. The first is found, with a uniquely determined position; the second and third are not found; the fourth could match any position in `[1, 4]`.

assert_eq!(s.binary_search(&100), Err(13));
let r = s.binary_search(&1);
assert!(match r { Ok(1..=4) => true, _ => false, });
```

If you want to find that whole *range* of matching items, rather than an arbitrary matching one, that can be done using [`partition_point`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.partition_point "method slice::partition_point"):

```rust
let s = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55];

let low = s.partition_point(|x| x < &1);
assert_eq!(low, 1);
let high = s.partition_point(|x| x <= &1);
assert_eq!(high, 5);
let r = s.binary_search(&1);
assert!((low..high).contains(&r.unwrap()));

assert!(s[..low].iter().all(|&x| x < 1));
assert!(s[low..high].iter().all(|&x| x == 1));
assert!(s[high..].iter().all(|&x| x > 1));

// For something not found, the "range" of equal items is empty
assert_eq!(s.partition_point(|x| x < &11), 9);
assert_eq!(s.partition_point(|x| x <= &11), 9);
assert_eq!(s.binary_search(&11), Err(9));
```

If you want to insert an item to a sorted vector, while maintaining sort order, consider using [`partition_point`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.partition_point "method slice::partition_point"):

```rust
let mut s = vec![0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55];
let num = 42;
let idx = s.partition_point(|&x| x <= num);
// If `num` is unique, `s.partition_point(|&x| x < num)` (with `<`) is equivalent to
// `s.binary_search(&num).unwrap_or_else(|x| x)`, but using `<=` will allow `insert`

Binary searches this slice with a comparator function.

The comparator function should return an order code that indicates whether its argument is `Less`, `Equal` or `Greater` the desired target. If the slice is not sorted or if the comparator function does not implement an order consistent with the sort order of the underlying slice, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless.

If the value is found then [`Result::Ok`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#variant.Ok "variant std::result::Result::Ok") is returned, containing the index of the matching element. If there are multiple matches, then any one of the matches could be returned. The index is chosen deterministically, but is subject to change in future versions of Rust. If the value is not found then [`Result::Err`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#variant.Err "variant std::result::Result::Err") is returned, containing the index where a matching element could be inserted while maintaining sorted order.

Sorts the slice in ascending order **without** preserving the initial order of equal elements.

This sort is unstable (i.e., may reorder equal elements), in-place (i.e., does not allocate), and *O*(*n* * log(*n*)) worst-case.

If the implementation of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord") for `T` does not implement a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order), the function may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.

For example `|a, b| (a - b).cmp(a)` is a comparison function that is neither transitive nor reflexive nor total, `a < b < c < a` with `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`. For more information and examples see the [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord") documentation.

All original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior mutability are observed in the input. Same is true if the implementation of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord") for `T` panics.

Sorting types that only implement [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html "trait std::cmp::PartialOrd") such as [`f32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html "primitive f32") and [`f64`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html "primitive f64") require additional precautions. For example, `f32::NAN != f32::NAN`, which doesn’t fulfill the reflexivity requirement of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord"). By using an alternative comparison function with `slice::sort_unstable_by` such as [`f32::total_cmp`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#method.total_cmp "method f32::total_cmp") or [`f64::total_cmp`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html#method.total_cmp "method f64::total_cmp") that defines a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order) users can sort slices containing floating-point values. Alternatively, if all values in the slice are guaranteed to be in a subset for which [`PartialOrd::partial_cmp`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html#tymethod.partial_cmp "method std::cmp::PartialOrd::partial_cmp") forms a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order), it’s possible to sort the slice with `sort_unstable_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())`.

##### [§](#current-implementation)Current implementation

The current implementation is based on [ipnsort](https://github.com/Voultapher/sort-research-rs/tree/main/ipnsort) by Lukas Bergdoll and Orson Peters, which combines the fast average case of quicksort with the fast worst case of heapsort, achieving linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. On inputs with k distinct elements, the expected time to sort the data is *O*(*n* * log(*k*)).

It is typically faster than stable sorting, except in a few special cases, e.g., when the slice is partially sorted.

Reorders the slice such that the element at `index` is at a sort-order position. All elements before `index` will be `<=` to this value, and all elements after will be `>=` to it.

Returns a triple that partitions the reordered slice:

This reordering is unstable (i.e. any element that compares equal to the nth element may end up at that position), in-place (i.e. does not allocate), and runs in *O*(*n*) time. This function is also known as “kth element” in other libraries.

Returns a triple partitioning the reordered slice:

- The unsorted subslice before `index`, whose elements all satisfy `f(x) <= f(self[index])`.
- The element at `index`.
- The unsorted subslice after `index`, whose elements all satisfy `f(x) >= f(self[index])`.

##### [§](#current-implementation-5)Current implementation

The current algorithm is an introselect implementation based on [ipnsort](https://github.com/Voultapher/sort-research-rs/tree/main/ipnsort) by Lukas Bergdoll and Orson Peters, which is also the basis for [`sort_unstable`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_unstable "method slice::sort_unstable"). The fallback algorithm is Median of Medians using Tukey’s Ninther for pivot selection, which guarantees linear runtime for all inputs.

##### [§](#panics-45)Panics

Panics when `index >= len()`, meaning it always panics on empty slices.

May panic if `K: Ord` does not implement a total order.

##### [§](#examples-148)Examples

```rust
let mut v = [-5i32, 4, 1, -3, 2];

// Find the items `<=` to the absolute median, the absolute median itself, and the items
// `>=` to it.
let (lesser, median, greater) = v.select_nth_unstable_by_key(2, |a| a.abs());

assert!(lesser == [1, 2] || lesser == [2, 1]);
assert_eq!(median, &mut -3);
assert!(greater == [4, -5] || greater == [-5, 4]);

// We are only guaranteed the slice will be one of the following, based on the way we sort
// about the specified index.
assert!(v == [1, 2, -3, 4, -5] ||
        v == [1, 2, -3, -5, 4] ||
        v == [2, 1, -3, 4, -5] ||
        v == [2, 1, -3, -5, 4]);

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`slice_partition_dedup` [#54279](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54279))

Moves all consecutive repeated elements to the end of the slice according to the [`PartialEq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html "trait std::cmp::PartialEq") trait implementation.

Returns two slices. The first contains no consecutive repeated elements. The second contains all the duplicates in no specified order.

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`slice_partition_dedup` [#54279](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54279))

Moves all but the first of consecutive elements to the end of the slice satisfying a given equality relation.

Returns two slices. The first contains no consecutive repeated elements. The second contains all the duplicates in no specified order.

The `same_bucket` function is passed references to two elements from the slice and must determine if the elements compare equal. The elements are passed in opposite order from their order in the slice, so if `same_bucket(a, b)` returns `true`, `a` is moved at the end of the slice.

If the slice is sorted, the first returned slice contains no duplicates.

##### [§](#panics-53)Panics

This will panic if the size of the SIMD type is different from `LANES` times that of the scalar.

At the time of writing, the trait restrictions on `Simd<T, LANES>` keeps that from ever happening, as only power-of-two numbers of lanes are supported. It’s possible that, in the future, those restrictions might be lifted in a way that would make it possible to see panics from this method for something like `LANES == 3`.

Checks if the elements of this slice are sorted.

That is, for each element `a` and its following element `b`, `a <= b` must hold. If the slice yields exactly zero or one element, `true` is returned.

Note that if `Self::Item` is only `PartialOrd`, but not `Ord`, the above definition implies that this function returns `false` if any two consecutive items are not comparable.

Checks if the elements of this slice are sorted using the given key extraction function.

Instead of comparing the slice’s elements directly, this function compares the keys of the elements, as determined by `f`. Apart from that, it’s equivalent to [`is_sorted`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.is_sorted "method slice::is_sorted"); see its documentation for more information.

```

1.52.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/slice/mod.rs.html#4854-4856)

Returns the index of the partition point according to the given predicate (the index of the first element of the second partition).

The slice is assumed to be partitioned according to the given predicate. This means that all elements for which the predicate returns true are at the start of the slice and all elements for which the predicate returns false are at the end. For example, `[7, 15, 3, 5, 4, 12, 6]` is partitioned under the predicate `x % 2 != 0` (all odd numbers are at the start, all even at the end).

If this slice is not partitioned, the returned result is unspecified and meaningless, as this method performs a kind of binary search.

See also [`binary_search`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.binary_search "method slice::binary_search"), [`binary_search_by`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.binary_search_by "method slice::binary_search_by"), and [`binary_search_by_key`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.binary_search_by_key "method slice::binary_search_by_key").

##### [§](#examples-167)Examples

```rust
let v = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 7];
let i = v.partition_point(|&x| x < 5);

assert_eq!(i, 4);
assert!(v[..i].iter().all(|&x| x < 5));
assert!(v[i..].iter().all(|&x| !(x < 5)));
```

If all elements of the slice match the predicate, including if the slice is empty, then the length of the slice will be returned:

```rust
let a = [2, 4, 8];
assert_eq!(a.partition_point(|x| x < &100), a.len());
let a: [i32; 0] = [];
assert_eq!(a.partition_point(|x| x < &100), 0);
```

If you want to insert an item to a sorted vector, while maintaining sort order:

```rust
let mut s = vec![0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55];
let num = 42;
let idx = s.partition_point(|&x| x <= num);
s.insert(idx, num);
assert_eq!(s, [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 42, 55]);

Sorts the slice in ascending order, preserving initial order of equal elements.

This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and *O*(*n* * log(*n*)) worst-case.

If the implementation of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord") for `T` does not implement a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order), the function may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.

When applicable, unstable sorting is preferred because it is generally faster than stable sorting and it doesn’t allocate auxiliary memory. See [`sort_unstable`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_unstable "method slice::sort_unstable"). The exception are partially sorted slices, which may be better served with `slice::sort`.

Sorting types that only implement [`PartialOrd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html "trait std::cmp::PartialOrd") such as [`f32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html "primitive f32") and [`f64`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html "primitive f64") require additional precautions. For example, `f32::NAN != f32::NAN`, which doesn’t fulfill the reflexivity requirement of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord"). By using an alternative comparison function with `slice::sort_by` such as [`f32::total_cmp`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f32.html#method.total_cmp "method f32::total_cmp") or [`f64::total_cmp`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.f64.html#method.total_cmp "method f64::total_cmp") that defines a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order) users can sort slices containing floating-point values. Alternatively, if all values in the slice are guaranteed to be in a subset for which [`PartialOrd::partial_cmp`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialOrd.html#tymethod.partial_cmp "method std::cmp::PartialOrd::partial_cmp") forms a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order), it’s possible to sort the slice with `sort_by(|a, b| a.partial_cmp(b).unwrap())`.

##### [§](#current-implementation-6)Current implementation

On inputs with k distinct elements, the expected time to sort the data is *O*(*n* * log(*k*)).

The auxiliary memory allocation behavior depends on the input length. Short slices are handled without allocation, medium sized slices allocate `self.len()` and beyond that it clamps at `self.len() / 2`.

All safe functions on slices preserve the invariant that even if the function panics, all original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior mutability are observed in the input. This ensures that recovery code (for instance inside of a `Drop` or following a `catch_unwind`) will still have access to all the original elements.

All safe functions on slices preserve the invariant that even if the function panics, all original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior mutability are observed in the input. This ensures that recovery code (for instance inside of a `Drop` or following a `catch_unwind`) will still have access to all the original elements. For instance, if the slice belongs to a `Vec`, the `Vec::drop` method will be able to dispose of all contained elements.

##### [§](#examples-180)Examples

```rust
let mut v = [4i32, -5, 1, -3, 2];

v.sort_by_key(|k| k.abs());
assert_eq!(v, [1, 2, -3, 4, -5]);
```

1.34.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/slice.rs.html#312-315)

Sorts the slice in ascending order with a key extraction function, preserving initial order of equal elements.

This sort is stable (i.e., does not reorder equal elements) and *O*(*m* * *n* + *n* * log(*n*)) worst-case, where the key function is *O*(*m*).

During sorting, the key function is called at most once per element, by using temporary storage to remember the results of key evaluation. The order of calls to the key function is unspecified and may change in future versions of the standard library.

If the implementation of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord") for `K` does not implement a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order), the function may panic; even if the function exits normally, the resulting order of elements in the slice is unspecified. See also the note on panicking below.

For simple key functions (e.g., functions that are property accesses or basic operations), [`sort_by_key`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.sort_by_key "method slice::sort_by_key") is likely to be faster.

##### [§](#current-implementation-9)Current implementation

The current implementation is based on [instruction-parallel-network sort](https://github.com/Voultapher/sort-research-rs/tree/main/ipnsort) by Lukas Bergdoll, which combines the fast average case of randomized quicksort with the fast worst case of heapsort, while achieving linear time on fully sorted and reversed inputs. And *O*(*k* * log(*n*)) where *k* is the number of distinct elements in the input. It leverages superscalar out-of-order execution capabilities commonly found in CPUs, to efficiently perform the operation.

In the worst case, the algorithm allocates temporary storage in a `Vec<(K, usize)>` the length of the slice.

##### [§](#panics-59)Panics

May panic if the implementation of [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord") for `K` does not implement a [total order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order), or if the [`Ord`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.Ord.html "trait std::cmp::Ord") implementation panics.

All safe functions on slices preserve the invariant that even if the function panics, all original elements will remain in the slice and any possible modifications via interior mutability are observed in the input. This ensures that recovery code (for instance inside of a `Drop` or following a `catch_unwind`) will still have access to all the original elements.

[Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/collections/vec_deque/mod.rs.html#3746)[§](#method.from-3)

Turn a [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html "struct std::vec::Vec") into a [`VecDeque<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html "struct std::collections::VecDeque").

This conversion is guaranteed to run in *O*(1) time and to not re-allocate the `Vec`’s buffer or allocate any additional memory.

[Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/alloc/collections/vec_deque/mod.rs.html#3783)[§](#method.from-4)

This never needs to re-allocate, but does need to do *O*(*n*) data movement if the circular buffer doesn’t happen to be at the beginning of the allocation.

##### [§](#examples-189)Examples

let ptr = deque.as_slices().0.as_ptr();
let vec = Vec::from(deque);
assert_eq!(vec, [1, 2, 3, 4]);
assert_eq!(vec.as_ptr(), ptr);

// This one needs data rearranging.
let mut deque: VecDeque<_> = (1..5).collect();
deque.push_front(9);

#### [§](#allocation-behavior)Allocation behavior

In general `Vec` does not guarantee any particular growth or allocation strategy. That also applies to this trait impl.

**Note:** This section covers implementation details and is therefore exempt from stability guarantees.

Vec may use any or none of the following strategies, depending on the supplied iterator:

- preallocate based on [`Iterator::size_hint()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.size_hint "method std::iter::Iterator::size_hint")
  
  - and panic if the number of items is outside the provided lower/upper bounds
- use an amortized growth strategy similar to `pushing` one item at a time
- perform the iteration in-place on the original allocation backing the iterator

The last case warrants some attention. It is an optimization that in many cases reduces peak memory consumption and improves cache locality. But when big, short-lived allocations are created, only a small fraction of their items get collected, no further use is made of the spare capacity and the resulting `Vec` is moved into a longer-lived structure, then this can lead to the large allocations having their lifetimes unnecessarily extended which can result in increased memory footprint.

In cases where this is an issue, the excess capacity can be discarded with [`Vec::shrink_to()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to "method std::vec::Vec::shrink_to"), [`Vec::shrink_to_fit()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.shrink_to_fit "method std::vec::Vec::shrink_to_fit") or by collecting into [`Box<[T]>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html "struct std::boxed::Box") instead, which additionally reduces the size of the long-lived struct.

```rust
static LONG_LIVED: Mutex<Vec<Vec<u16>>> = Mutex::new(Vec::new());

for i in 0..10 {
    let big_temporary: Vec<u16> = (0..1024).collect();
    // discard most items
    let mut result: Vec<_> = big_temporary.into_iter().filter(|i| i % 100 == 0).collect();
    // without this a lot of unused capacity might be moved into the global
    result.shrink_to_fit();
    LONG_LIVED.lock().unwrap().push(result);
}
```
