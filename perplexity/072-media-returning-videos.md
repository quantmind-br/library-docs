# Returning Videos

> Learn how to return videos in API responses using media_response overrides with raw HTTP requests

## Overview

Grounded LLMs can return videos as part of their responses to provide rich multimedia content that enhances the information delivered. You can control video returns using the `media_response` parameter with `overrides` to specify when videos should be included in responses.

<Info>
  The `return_videos` feature is currently only available in the Chat Completions API.
</Info>

<Note>
  Use the `media_response.overrides.return_videos` parameter to control when videos are returned in API responses.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Video returns may increase response size and processing time. Use this feature selectively for queries where video content adds significant value.
</Warning>

## Basic Usage

To enable video returns, include the `media_response` parameter with `overrides.return_videos` set to `true` in your request.

### Simple Video Request

Noah Lyles won his first Olympic gold in the men's 100m with a dramatic, lifetime-best 9.784 seconds[3][4]. Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own women's 400m hurdles world record yet again[3].\n\n- **Gymnastics Spectacle:** The games featured high drama and new records in **artistic gymnastics**, with full event replays and standout moments available for fans[5].\n\n- **Historic Firsts:** Several nations, including **Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde, and Albania**, celebrated their first-ever Olympic medals—some of them gold[1].

## Combined Media Responses

You can combine video returns with other media response options:

### Videos with Images

```bash  theme={null}
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "media_response": {
      "overrides": {
        "return_videos": true,
        "return_images": true
      }
    },
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Mars rover discoveries 2024"
      }
    ]
  }' | jq
```

### Videos with Search Filters

```bash  theme={null}
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "search_recency_filter": "week",
    "media_response": {
      "overrides": {
        "return_videos": true
      }
    },
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Latest SpaceX launch footage"
      }
    ]
  }' | jq
```

## Advanced Usage

### Streaming with Videos

Enable streaming responses while including video content:

```bash  theme={null}
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "stream": true,
    "media_response": {
      "overrides": {
        "return_videos": true
      }
    },
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Breaking news today with video coverage"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Multi-turn Conversation with Videos

Continue a conversation while maintaining video context:

```bash  theme={null}
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "media_response": {
      "overrides": {
        "return_videos": true
      }
    },
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Show me cooking videos for pasta recipes"
      },
      {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "Here are some great pasta cooking videos..."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Now show me videos for making homemade sauce"
      }
    ]
  }' | jq
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Query Optimization">
    * **Be specific**: Use descriptive queries that clearly indicate when video content would be valuable
    * **Include context**: Mention specific events, products, or topics that commonly have video coverage
    * **Use recency filters**: Combine with search filters to get the most current video content
    * **Consider query intent**: Videos work best for demonstrations, tutorials, events, and visual explanations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Performance Considerations">
    * **Monitor response times**: Video-enabled requests may take longer to process
    * **Handle larger payloads**: Responses containing videos will be larger than text-only responses
    * **Implement timeouts**: Set appropriate timeout values for video-enabled requests
    * **Cache strategically**: Consider caching video responses for frequently requested content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Quality">
    * **Verify video relevance**: Not all queries will return relevant video content
    * **Handle empty results**: Implement fallback logic when no videos are available
    * **Check video accessibility**: Ensure returned video content is accessible and appropriate
    * **Validate video links**: Test that returned video URLs are functional before displaying
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Response Format

When videos are returned, they appear in the response content along with text. The videos will be included as part of the response structure, with video URLs and metadata available for display or processing.

## Common Use Cases

### News and Current Events

```bash  theme={null}
# Get breaking news with video coverage
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "search_recency_filter": "day",
    "media_response": {
      "overrides": {
        "return_videos": true
      }
    },
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Latest political developments today"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Product Reviews and Demonstrations

```bash  theme={null}
# Get product demo videos
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "media_response": {
      "overrides": {
        "return_videos": true
      }
    },
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "MacBook Pro M4 unboxing and first impressions"}
    ]
  }'
```

### Educational and How-to Content

```bash  theme={null}
# Get tutorial videos
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "sonar-pro",
    "media_response": {
      "overrides": {
        "return_videos": true
      }
    },
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "How to change a car tire step by step"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Videos Returned">
    If your request doesn't return videos:

    * Verify the `media_response.overrides.return_videos` parameter is set to `true`
    * Check that your query is likely to have video content available
    * Ensure you're using a model that supports video returns (sonar-pro recommended)
    * Try different query phrasings that explicitly mention video content
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request Timeouts">
    For timeout issues:

    * Increase your request timeout settings
    * Use streaming responses for better user experience
    * Consider breaking complex queries into smaller parts
    * Implement retry logic for failed requests
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Large Response Handling">
    When dealing with video-heavy responses:

    * Implement proper JSON parsing for large payloads
    * Consider pagination for multiple video results
    * Use appropriate data structures to handle media content
    * Implement progressive loading for video content
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Limitations

<Warning>
  **Current Limitations:**

  * Video returns may not be available for all query types
  * Response times will be longer when videos are included
  * Video content availability depends on external sources
  * Some video content may be region-restricted
  * No direct video format or quality control options currently available
</Warning>

## Environment Variables

For security, use environment variables for your API key:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```bash  theme={null}
    set PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Then reference it in your requests:

```bash  theme={null}
curl https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "sonar-pro", ...}'
```

<Tip>
  Start with simple queries to test video returns, then gradually build more complex requests as you understand the response patterns and performance characteristics.
