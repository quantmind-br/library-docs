Droid works best with clear, specific instructions. Like pairing with a skilled engineer, the quality of your communication directly affects the results. This guide shows practical patterns that get better outcomes with fewer iterations.

## Core principles

**Be explicit about what you want.** Instead of “can you improve the auth system?” try “add rate limiting to login attempts with exponential backoff following the pattern in middleware/rateLimit.ts.” Droid performs best when you clearly state your goal. **Provide context upfront.** Include error messages, file paths, screenshots, or relevant documentation. If you’re implementing something from a Jira ticket or design doc, paste the link—droid can automatically read context from platforms you’ve integrated in Factory’s dashboard. **Choose your approach.** For complex features, consider using Specification Mode for automatic planning. For routine tasks, droid can proceed directly while still showing you all changes for review. See the [Planning versus doing](#planning-versus-doing) section for detailed guidance. **Define success.** Tell droid how to verify the work is complete—run specific tests, check that a service starts cleanly, or confirm a UI matches a mockup.

## Writing effective prompts

The best prompts are direct and include relevant details:

```
Add comprehensive error handling to the payment processor in src/payments/processor.ts.
Catch gateway timeouts and retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
Similar retry logic exists in src/notifications/sender.ts.
Run the payment integration tests to verify it works.
```

```
Run the build and fix all TypeScript errors. Focus on the auth module first.
```

```
Review my uncommitted changes with git diff and suggest improvements before I commit.
```

```
The login form allows empty submissions. Add client-side validation and return proper error messages.
Check that localhost:3000/login shows validation errors when fields are empty.
```

```
Refactor the database connection logic into a separate module but don't change any query interfaces.
```

Notice these examples:

- State the goal clearly in the first sentence
- Include specific files or commands when known
- Mention related code that might help
- Explain how to test the result
- Keep it conversational but direct

## Planning versus doing

For complex features, use [Specification Mode](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/user-guides/specification-mode) which automatically provides planning and review before implementation:

```
Add user preferences API with key-value storage following REST conventions.
Include validation and comprehensive tests.
```

For straightforward tasks, droid can proceed directly while still showing you changes for approval:

```
Fix the failing test in tests/auth.test.ts line 42
```

```
Add logging to the startup sequence with appropriate log levels.
```

## Managing context

**Use AGENTS.md files** to document build commands, testing procedures, and coding standards. Droid reads these automatically, so you don’t have to repeat project conventions. See the [AGENTS.md guide](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/agents-md) for detailed setup instructions. **Mention specific files** when you know where the code lives. Use `@filename` to reference files directly, or include file paths in your prompts. This focuses droid’s attention and saves time. **Set boundaries** for changes. “Only modify files in the auth directory” or “don’t change the public API” helps contain the scope. **Reference external resources** by including URLs to tickets, docs, designs, or specs. Droid can fetch and use this information.

## Common workflows

**Understanding code:**

```
Explain how user authentication flows through this system.
```

```
What are the main components in the frontend and how do they interact?
```

**Implementing features:**

```
Add a PATCH /users/:id endpoint with email uniqueness validation.
Update the OpenAPI spec and add integration tests.
Similar patterns exist in src/routes/users/get.ts.
```

**Fixing bugs:**

```
Users report file uploads fail randomly. Error in browser console: "Network timeout".
Upload logic is in src/upload/handler.ts. Check for timeout handling.
```

**Code review:**

```
Look at git diff and review these changes for security issues and maintainability.
```

**Refactoring:**

```
Extract the email sending logic into a separate service class.
Keep the same interfaces but make it testable in isolation.
```

## Enterprise integration

Reference your team’s tools by pasting links to tickets or documents:

```
Implement the feature described in this Jira ticket: https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123
Follow our security standards from the compliance docs.
```

If you’ve integrated these platforms in Factory’s dashboard, droid can automatically read context from Jira, Notion, Slack, and other sources. For additional tool connections, droid also supports MCP integrations. For security-sensitive work:

```
Add file upload functionality with proper validation to prevent directory traversal attacks.
Follow the security patterns used in our document upload feature.
```

## Session management

Start new conversations when context gets cluttered or when switching to unrelated tasks. Fresh context often works better than accumulated noise from failed attempts. For large projects, break work into phases:

```
First implement the database schema changes. Don't add the API endpoints yet.
```

Then in a follow-up:

```
Now add the REST endpoints using the new schema. Include validation and error handling.
```

## Advanced techniques

**Test-driven development:**

```
Write comprehensive tests for the user registration flow first.
Don't implement the actual registration logic yet.
```

**Plan-driven development:**

```
Create a markdown file outlining the plan for updating both backend API and React components.
Include the shared data structure and implementation order.
Then implement each part following the documented plan.
```

## Examples of good prompts

Here are real examples that work well:

```
Run git blame on the file I have open and figure out who added the rate limiting logic.
```

```
Look at git diff staged and remove any debug statements before I commit.
```

```
Convert these 5 React components to use TypeScript. Use proper interfaces for props.
```

```
Find the commit that introduced the caching mechanism and explain how it works.
```

```
Add input validation to all the forms in the admin panel. Return 400 with clear error messages.
```

```
Check the production logs for any errors in the last hour and suggest fixes for the most common ones.
```

## What doesn’t work well

Avoid vague requests:

- “Make the app better” → too broad
- “Fix the database” → not specific enough
- “Can you help with the frontend?” → unclear goal

Don’t make droid guess:

- If you know the file path, include it
- If you know the command to run, mention it
- If there’s related code, point to it

## Getting better results

Treat droid like a capable teammate. Provide the same context and guidance you’d give a colleague working on the task. Be specific about quality standards and business requirements. Remember that droid learns your organization’s patterns over time. The more consistently you use it within your codebase, the better it becomes at following your conventions. Most importantly, review the changes droid proposes. You maintain full control through the approval workflow, so take time to understand modifications and provide feedback for better future results.
