## Student Collaborations - create

Allows user to create collaborations.

Allows user to view, edit, and delete collaborations they created.

### Additional Considerations

To allow view edit delete functionality of collaborations created by other users, Course Content - add / edit / delete must also be enabled.

If Course Content - add / edit / delete is enabled and Student Collaborations - create is disabled, the user will not be able to create new collaborations but will be able to view edit delete all collaborations.

To add students to a collaboration, Users - view list must also be enabled.

To add a course group to a collaboration, Groups - add must also be enabled.
