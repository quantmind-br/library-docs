## Module process

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/process.rs.html#1-2619)

Expand description

A module for working with processes.

This module is mostly concerned with spawning and interacting with child processes, but it also provides [`abort`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/fn.abort.html "fn std::process::abort") and [`exit`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/fn.exit.html "fn std::process::exit") for terminating the current process.

## [§](#spawning-a-process)Spawning a process

The [`Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html "struct std::process::Command") struct is used to configure and spawn processes:

```rust
use std::process::Command;

let output = Command::new("echo")
    .arg("Hello world")
    .output()
    .expect("Failed to execute command");

assert_eq!(b"Hello world\n", output.stdout.as_slice());
```

Several methods on [`Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html "struct std::process::Command"), such as [`spawn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.spawn "method std::process::Command::spawn") or [`output`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.output "method std::process::Command::output"), can be used to spawn a process. In particular, [`output`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.output "method std::process::Command::output") spawns the child process and waits until the process terminates, while [`spawn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.spawn "method std::process::Command::spawn") will return a [`Child`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Child.html "struct std::process::Child") that represents the spawned child process.

## [§](#handling-io)Handling I/O

The [`stdout`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.stdout "method std::process::Command::stdout"), [`stdin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.stdin "method std::process::Command::stdin"), and [`stderr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.stderr "method std::process::Command::stderr") of a child process can be configured by passing an [`Stdio`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Stdio.html "struct std::process::Stdio") to the corresponding method on [`Command`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html "struct std::process::Command"). Once spawned, they can be accessed from the [`Child`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Child.html "struct std::process::Child"). For example, piping output from one command into another command can be done like so:

```rust
use std::process::{Command, Stdio};

// stdout must be configured with `Stdio::piped` in order to use
// `echo_child.stdout`
let echo_child = Command::new("echo")
    .arg("Oh no, a tpyo!")
    .stdout(Stdio::piped())
    .spawn()
    .expect("Failed to start echo process");

// Note that `echo_child` is moved here, but we won't be needing
// `echo_child` anymore
let echo_out = echo_child.stdout.expect("Failed to open echo stdout");

let mut sed_child = Command::new("sed")
    .arg("s/tpyo/typo/")
    .stdin(Stdio::from(echo_out))
    .stdout(Stdio::piped())
    .spawn()
    .expect("Failed to start sed process");

let output = sed_child.wait_with_output().expect("Failed to wait on sed");
assert_eq!(b"Oh no, a typo!\n", output.stdout.as_slice());
```

Note that [`ChildStderr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.ChildStderr.html "struct std::process::ChildStderr") and [`ChildStdout`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.ChildStdout.html "struct std::process::ChildStdout") implement [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html "trait std::io::Read") and [`ChildStdin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.ChildStdin.html "struct std::process::ChildStdin") implements [`Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html "trait std::io::Write"):

```rust
use std::process::{Command, Stdio};
use std::io::Write;

let mut child = Command::new("/bin/cat")
    .stdin(Stdio::piped())
    .stdout(Stdio::piped())
    .spawn()
    .expect("failed to execute child");

// If the child process fills its stdout buffer, it may end up
// waiting until the parent reads the stdout, and not be able to
// read stdin in the meantime, causing a deadlock.
// Writing from another thread ensures that stdout is being read
// at the same time, avoiding the problem.
let mut stdin = child.stdin.take().expect("failed to get stdin");
std::thread::spawn(move || {
    stdin.write_all(b"test").expect("failed to write to stdin");
});

let output = child
    .wait_with_output()
    .expect("failed to wait on child");

assert_eq!(b"test", output.stdout.as_slice());
```

## [§](#windows-argument-splitting)Windows argument splitting

On Unix systems arguments are passed to a new process as an array of strings, but on Windows arguments are passed as a single commandline string and it is up to the child process to parse it into an array. Therefore the parent and child processes must agree on how the commandline string is encoded.

Most programs use the standard C run-time `argv`, which in practice results in consistent argument handling. However, some programs have their own way of parsing the commandline string. In these cases using [`arg`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.arg "method std::process::Command::arg") or [`args`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.args "method std::process::Command::args") may result in the child process seeing a different array of arguments than the parent process intended.

Two ways of mitigating this are:

- Validate untrusted input so that only a safe subset is allowed.
- Use [`raw_arg`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/windows/process/trait.CommandExt.html#tymethod.raw_arg "method std::os::windows::process::CommandExt::raw_arg") to build a custom commandline. This bypasses the escaping rules used by [`arg`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.arg "method std::process::Command::arg") so should be used with due caution.

`cmd.exe` and `.bat` files use non-standard argument parsing and are especially vulnerable to malicious input as they may be used to run arbitrary shell commands. Untrusted arguments should be restricted as much as possible. For examples on handling this see [`raw_arg`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/windows/process/trait.CommandExt.html#tymethod.raw_arg "method std::os::windows::process::CommandExt::raw_arg").

#### [§](#batch-file-special-handling)Batch file special handling

On Windows, `Command` uses the Windows API function [`CreateProcessW`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-createprocessw) to spawn new processes. An undocumented feature of this function is that when given a `.bat` file as the application to run, it will automatically convert that into running `cmd.exe /c` with the batch file as the next argument.

For historical reasons Rust currently preserves this behavior when using [`Command::new`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.new "associated function std::process::Command::new"), and escapes the arguments according to `cmd.exe` rules. Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe` argument handling, it might not be possible to safely escape some special characters, and using them will result in an error being returned at process spawn. The set of unescapeable special characters might change between releases.

Also note that running batch scripts in this way may be removed in the future and so should not be relied upon.
