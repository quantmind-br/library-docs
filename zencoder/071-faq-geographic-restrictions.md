As of November 19, 2025, Zencoder services are unavailable in the following countries based on current OFAC sanctions programs:

Access is restricted in accordance with current U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws as administered and enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Restricted jurisdictions may change based on updates to applicable sanctions programs. **Disclaimer**: This list is subject to change based on updates to U.S. export control and sanctions regulations. For the most current information about service availability in your region, please [contact Zencoder Support](https://zencoder.ai/contact).

## Why Are Services Restricted?

Service restrictions are implemented to comply with U.S. export control and economic sanctions laws administered by OFAC.

## Access from Restricted Regions

If you attempt to access Zencoder from a restricted region, you will receive a message indicating that the service is not available in your location. Your access will be blocked to ensure regulatory compliance. This determination is made based on your IP address and geographic location data. Access through VPNs, proxies, or other circumvention methods is strictly prohibited and will result in immediate service termination. Any attempt to bypass these geographic restrictions constitutes a material breach of our [Terms of Service (Section 5.4)](https://zencoder.ai/legal/terms-of-service) and may violate applicable U.S. export control laws.
