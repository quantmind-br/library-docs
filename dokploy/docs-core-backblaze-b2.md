S3 Destinations

Configure buckets from Backblaze B2 for backup storage. This includes setting up access keys, secret keys, bucket names, regions, and endpoints.

Backblaze B2 is a cloud-based service that allows you to store and retrieve data from anywhere in the world. This is a great option for storing backups, as it is easy to set up and manage.

1. Create a new bucket and set any name you want.
2. Go to `Application Keys` and create a new key.
3. Set a Key Name.
4. Set the Allow Access to Bucket(s) to `All Buckets` or `Specific Buckets`.
5. Set type of access `Read & Write` Permission.

Now copy the following variables:

- `Access Key` -&gt; `Access Key (Dokploy)` = eg. `002s6acf2639910000d000005`
- `Secret Key` -&gt; `Secret Key (Dokploy)` = eg. `K00+rIsWqPMhmcgqcyOyb9bqby7pbpE`
- `Region` -&gt; `Region (Dokploy)` = eg. `eu-central-003, us-east-005, us-west-002, us-west-001, us-west-004, etc` it will depend on the region you are using.
- `Endpoint` -&gt; `Endpoint (Dokploy)` = eg. `https://s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com` you will find this endpoint in the Bucket Card at the Home Page.
- `Bucket` -&gt; `Bucket (Dokploy)` = eg. `dokploy-backups` use the name of the bucket you created.

Test the connection and you should see a success message.
