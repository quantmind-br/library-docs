Did you know that you can use Docker to build your application to standalone binaries? Sometimes, you don’t want to package and distribute your application as a Docker image. Use Docker to build your application, and use exporters to save the output to disk.

The default output format for `docker build` is a container image. That image is automatically loaded to your local image store, where you can run a container from that image, or push it to a registry. Under the hood, this uses the default exporter, called the `docker` exporter.

To export your build results as files instead, you can use the `--output` flag, or `-o` for short. the `--output` flag lets you change the output format of your build.

If you specify a filepath to the `docker build --output` flag, Docker exports the contents of the build container at the end of the build to the specified location on your host's filesystem. This uses the `local` [exporter](https://docs.docker.com/build/exporters/local-tar/).

The neat thing about this is that you can use Docker's powerful isolation and build features to create standalone binaries. This works well for Go, Rust, and other languages that can compile to a single binary.

The following example creates a simple Rust program that prints "Hello, World!", and exports the binary to the host filesystem.

1. Create a new directory for this example, and navigate to it:
2. Create a Dockerfile with the following contents:
   
   > The `COPY <<EOT` syntax is a [here-document](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#here-documents). It lets you write multi-line strings in a Dockerfile. Here it's used to create a simple Rust program inline in the Dockerfile.
   
   This Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build to compile the program in the first stage, and then copies the binary to a scratch image in the second. The final image is a minimal image that only contains the binary. This use case for the `scratch` image is common for creating minimal build artifacts for programs that don't require a full operating system to run.
3. Build the Dockerfile and export the binary to the current working directory:
   
   This command builds the Dockerfile and exports the binary to the current working directory. The binary is named `hello`, and it's created in the current working directory.

You use the `local` exporter to export binaries in combination with [multi-platform builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/). This lets you compile multiple binaries at once, that can be run on any machine of any architecture, provided that the target platform is supported by the compiler you use.

Continuing on the example Dockerfile in the [Export binaries from a build](#export-binaries-from-a-build) section:

You can build this Rust program for multiple platforms using the `--platform` flag with the `docker build` command. In combination with the `--output` flag, the build exports the binaries for each target to the specified directory.

For example, to build the program for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`:

In addition to the `local` exporter, there are other exporters available. To learn more about the available exporters and how to use them, see the [exporters](https://docs.docker.com/build/exporters/) documentation.
