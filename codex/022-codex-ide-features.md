# Codex IDE extension features

The Codex IDE extension gives you access to Codex directly in VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code-compatible editors. It uses the same agent as the Codex CLI and shares the same configuration.

## Prompting Codex

Use Codex in your editor to chat, edit, and preview changes seamlessly. When Codex has context from open files and selected code, you can write shorter prompts and get faster, more relevant results.

You can reference any file in your editor by tagging it in your prompt like this:

```text
Use @example.tsx as a reference to add a new page named "Resources" to the app that contains a list of resources defined in @resources.ts
```

## Switch between models

You can switch models with the switcher under the chat input.

<div class="not-prose max-w-[20rem] mr-auto">
  <img
    src="/images/codex/ide/switch_model.png"
    alt="Codex model switcher"
    class="block h-auto w-full mx-0!"
  />
</div>

## Adjust reasoning effort

You can adjust reasoning effort to control how long Codex thinks before responding. Higher effort can help on complex tasks, but responses take longer. Higher effort also uses more tokens and can consume your rate limits faster (especially with GPT-5-Codex).

Use the same model switcher shown above, and choose `low`, `medium`, or `high` for each model. Start with `medium`, and only switch to `high` when you need more depth.

## Choose an approval mode

By default, Codex runs in `Agent` mode. In this mode, Codex can read files, make edits, and run commands in the working directory automatically. Codex still needs your approval to work outside the working directory or access the network.

When you just want to chat, or you want to plan before making changes, switch to `Chat` with the switcher under the chat input.

<div class="not-prose max-w-[18rem] mr-auto">
  <img
    src="/images/codex/ide/approval_mode.png"
    alt="Codex approval modes"
    class="block h-auto w-full mx-0!"
  />
</div>
<br />

If you need Codex to read files, make edits, and run commands with network access without approval, use `Agent (Full Access)`. Exercise caution before doing so.

## Cloud delegation

You can offload larger jobs to Codex in the cloud, then track progress and review results without leaving your IDE.

1. Set up a [cloud environment for Codex](https://chatgpt.com/codex/settings/environments).
2. Pick your environment and select **Run in the cloud**.

You can have Codex run from `main` (useful for starting new ideas), or run from your local changes (useful for finishing a task).

<div class="not-prose max-w-xl mr-auto mb-6">
  <img
    src="/images/codex/ide/start_cloud_task.png"
    alt="Start a cloud task from the IDE"
    class="block h-auto w-full mx-0!"
  />
</div>

When you start a cloud task from a local conversation, Codex remembers the conversation context so it can pick up where you left off.

## Cloud task follow-up

The Codex extension makes previewing cloud changes straightforward. You can ask for follow-ups to run in the cloud, but often you'll want to apply the changes locally to test and finish. When you continue the conversation locally, Codex also retains context to save you time.

<div class="not-prose max-w-xl mr-auto mb-6">
  <img
    src="/images/codex/ide/load_cloud_task.png"
    alt="Load a cloud task into the IDE"
    class="block h-auto w-full mx-0!"
  />
</div>

You can also view the cloud tasks in the [Codex cloud interface](https://chatgpt.com/codex).

## Drag and drop images into the prompt

You can drag and drop images into the prompt composer to include them as context.

Hold down `Shift` while dropping an image. VS Code otherwise prevents extensions from accepting a drop.
