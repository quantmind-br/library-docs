## Users - view primary email address

Allows user to search for account users via primary email address in the account People page.

Allows user to search for other users via primary email address in a course People page.

### Additional Considerations

To view the account People page, Users - view list must be enabled.

If this permission is disabled, and Users - view login IDs is enabled, users will still see email addresses used as login IDs.
