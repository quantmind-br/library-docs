Prerequisite

This guide builds on top of the [Build Your Own UI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/build-your-own-ui/). It is recommended to read that guide first. Portions of the code will not be repeated here for brevity.

For a complete list of available UI Kit components, refer to the [Component Library](https://developers.cloudflare.com/realtime/realtimekit/ui-kit/component-library/).

In this guide, we will learn how to add a custom controlbar for your RealtimeKit meeting experience.
