Expand description

Traits, helpers, and type definitions for core I/O functionality.

The `std::io` module contains a number of common things you’ll need when doing input and output. The most core part of this module is the [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Read.html "trait std::io::Read") and [`Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Write.html "trait std::io::Write") traits, which provide the most general interface for reading and writing input and output.

### [§](#read-and-write)Read and Write

Because they are traits, [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Read.html "trait std::io::Read") and [`Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Write.html "trait std::io::Write") are implemented by a number of other types, and you can implement them for your types too. As such, you’ll see a few different types of I/O throughout the documentation in this module: [`File`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/struct.File.html "struct std::fs::File")s, [`TcpStream`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/net/struct.TcpStream.html "struct std::net::TcpStream")s, and sometimes even [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html "struct std::vec::Vec")s. For example, [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Read.html "trait std::io::Read") adds a [`read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Read.html#tymethod.read "method std::io::Read::read") method, which we can use on [`File`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/struct.File.html "struct std::fs::File")s:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
    let mut buffer = [0; 10];

    // read up to 10 bytes
    let n = f.read(&mut buffer)?;

    println!("The bytes: {:?}", &buffer[..n]);
    Ok(())
}
```

[`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Read.html "trait std::io::Read") and [`Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Write.html "trait std::io::Write") are so important, implementors of the two traits have a nickname: readers and writers. So you’ll sometimes see ‘a reader’ instead of ‘a type that implements the [`Read`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Read.html "trait std::io::Read") trait’. Much easier!

### [§](#seek-and-bufread)Seek and BufRead

Beyond that, there are two important traits that are provided: [`Seek`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Seek.html "trait std::io::Seek") and [`BufRead`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.BufRead.html "trait std::io::BufRead"). Both of these build on top of a reader to control how the reading happens. [`Seek`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Seek.html "trait std::io::Seek") lets you control where the next byte is coming from:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::io::SeekFrom;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
    let mut buffer = [0; 10];

    // skip to the last 10 bytes of the file
    f.seek(SeekFrom::End(-10))?;

    // read up to 10 bytes
    let n = f.read(&mut buffer)?;

    println!("The bytes: {:?}", &buffer[..n]);
    Ok(())
}
```

[`BufRead`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.BufRead.html "trait std::io::BufRead") uses an internal buffer to provide a number of other ways to read, but to show it off, we’ll need to talk about buffers in general. Keep reading!

### [§](#bufreader-and-bufwriter)BufReader and BufWriter

Byte-based interfaces are unwieldy and can be inefficient, as we’d need to be making near-constant calls to the operating system. To help with this, `std::io` comes with two structs, [`BufReader`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.BufReader.html "struct std::io::BufReader") and [`BufWriter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.BufWriter.html "struct std::io::BufWriter"), which wrap readers and writers. The wrapper uses a buffer, reducing the number of calls and providing nicer methods for accessing exactly what you want.

For example, [`BufReader`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.BufReader.html "struct std::io::BufReader") works with the [`BufRead`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.BufRead.html "trait std::io::BufRead") trait to add extra methods to any reader:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
    let mut reader = BufReader::new(f);
    let mut buffer = String::new();

    // read a line into buffer
    reader.read_line(&mut buffer)?;

    println!("{buffer}");
    Ok(())
}
```

[`BufWriter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.BufWriter.html "struct std::io::BufWriter") doesn’t add any new ways of writing; it just buffers every call to [`write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.Write.html#tymethod.write "method std::io::Write::write"):

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::io::BufWriter;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let f = File::create("foo.txt")?;
    {
        let mut writer = BufWriter::new(f);

        // write a byte to the buffer
        writer.write(&[42])?;

    } // the buffer is flushed once writer goes out of scope

    Ok(())
}
```

### [§](#standard-input-and-output)Standard input and output

A very common source of input is standard input:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut input = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input)?;

    println!("You typed: {}", input.trim());
    Ok(())
}
```

Note that you cannot use the [`?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/appendix-02-operators.html) in functions that do not return a [`Result<T, E>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html "enum std::result::Result"). Instead, you can call [`.unwrap()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/result/enum.Result.html#method.unwrap "method std::result::Result::unwrap") or `match` on the return value to catch any possible errors:

```rust
use std::io;

let mut input = String::new();

io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
```

And a very common source of output is standard output:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    io::stdout().write(&[42])?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Of course, using [`io::stdout`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/fn.stdout.html "fn std::io::stdout") directly is less common than something like [`println!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.println.html "macro std::println").

### [§](#iterator-types)Iterator types

A large number of the structures provided by `std::io` are for various ways of iterating over I/O. For example, [`Lines`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.Lines.html "struct std::io::Lines") is used to split over lines:

```rust
use std::io;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::io::BufReader;
use std::fs::File;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let f = File::open("foo.txt")?;
    let reader = BufReader::new(f);

    for line in reader.lines() {
        println!("{}", line?);
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

### [§](#functions)Functions

There are a number of [functions](#functions-1) that offer access to various features. For example, we can use three of these functions to copy everything from standard input to standard output:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    io::copy(&mut io::stdin(), &mut io::stdout())?;
    Ok(())
}
```

### [§](#ioresult)io::Result

Last, but certainly not least, is [`io::Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/type.Result.html "type std::io::Result"). This type is used as the return type of many `std::io` functions that can cause an error, and can be returned from your own functions as well. Many of the examples in this module use the [`?` operator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/appendix-02-operators.html):

```rust
use std::io;

fn read_input() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut input = String::new();

    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input)?;

    println!("You typed: {}", input.trim());

    Ok(())
}
```

The return type of `read_input()`, [`io::Result<()>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/type.Result.html "type std::io::Result"), is a very common type for functions which don’t have a ‘real’ return value, but do want to return errors if they happen. In this case, the only purpose of this function is to read the line and print it, so we use `()`.

### [§](#platform-specific-behavior)Platform-specific behavior

Many I/O functions throughout the standard library are documented to indicate what various library or syscalls they are delegated to. This is done to help applications both understand what’s happening under the hood as well as investigate any possibly unclear semantics. Note, however, that this is informative, not a binding contract. The implementation of many of these functions are subject to change over time and may call fewer or more syscalls/library functions.

### [§](#io-safety)I/O Safety

Rust follows an I/O safety discipline that is comparable to its memory safety discipline. This means that file descriptors can be *exclusively owned*. (Here, “file descriptor” is meant to subsume similar concepts that exist across a wide range of operating systems even if they might use a different name, such as “handle”.) An exclusively owned file descriptor is one that no other code is allowed to access in any way, but the owner is allowed to access and even close it any time. A type that owns its file descriptor should usually close it in its `drop` function. Types like [`File`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/fs/struct.File.html "struct std::fs::File") own their file descriptor. Similarly, file descriptors can be *borrowed*, granting the temporary right to perform operations on this file descriptor. This indicates that the file descriptor will not be closed for the lifetime of the borrow, but it does *not* imply any right to close this file descriptor, since it will likely be owned by someone else.

The platform-specific parts of the Rust standard library expose types that reflect these concepts, see [`os::unix`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/os/unix/io/index.html) and [`os::windows`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/os/windows/io/index.html).

To uphold I/O safety, it is crucial that no code acts on file descriptors it does not own or borrow, and no code closes file descriptors it does not own. In other words, a safe function that takes a regular integer, treats it as a file descriptor, and acts on it, is *unsound*.

Not upholding I/O safety and acting on a file descriptor without proof of ownership can lead to misbehavior and even Undefined Behavior in code that relies on ownership of its file descriptors: a closed file descriptor could be re-allocated, so the original owner of that file descriptor is now working on the wrong file. Some code might even rely on fully encapsulating its file descriptors with no operations being performed by any other part of the program.

Note that exclusive ownership of a file descriptor does *not* imply exclusive ownership of the underlying kernel object that the file descriptor references (also called “open file description” on some operating systems). File descriptors basically work like [`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Arc.html "struct std::sync::Arc"): when you receive an owned file descriptor, you cannot know whether there are any other file descriptors that reference the same kernel object. However, when you create a new kernel object, you know that you are holding the only reference to it. Just be careful not to lend it to anyone, since they can obtain a clone and then you can no longer know what the reference count is! In that sense, [`OwnedFd`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/os/fd/struct.OwnedFd.html) is like `Arc` and [`BorrowedFd<'a>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/os/fd/struct.BorrowedFd.html) is like `&'a Arc` (and similar for the Windows types). In particular, given a `BorrowedFd<'a>`, you are not allowed to close the file descriptor – just like how, given a `&'a Arc`, you are not allowed to decrement the reference count and potentially free the underlying object. There is no equivalent to `Box` for file descriptors in the standard library (that would be a type that guarantees that the reference count is `1`), however, it would be possible for a crate to define a type with those semantics.
