> Guide to connect Factory with your Linear workspace

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Factory with Linear, enabling seamless interaction between Factory and your Linear projects.

## Prerequisites

* Admin access to your Linear workspace
* A Factory account with admin privileges

## Integration Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Factory Integrations">
    Log in to your Factory account and navigate to the Integrations section in your Settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Initiate Linear Integration">
    Locate and select the Linear integration option.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authorize Factory's Linear Application">
    You'll be redirected to Linear. Review the requested permissions and click "Authorize" to allow Factory access to your Linear workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Team and Project Access">
    Select the teams and projects you want Factory to interact with. You can adjust these settings later if needed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Permissions">
    Ensure that Factory has the necessary permissions to view and create issues, manage workflows, and access relevant project data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Integration">
    After granting permissions, you'll be redirected back to Factory. Verify that the integration status shows as "Connected".
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Session">
    Create a New Session directly from Linear with this ticket in context by clicking the "🔗 Factory - Open in Factory" link

    * Note that clicking this link will always create a **new session**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Create a test issue in one of the authorized Linear projects.
2. Use Factory to interact with this issue (e.g., comment on it or change its status).
3. Verify that the changes are reflected in Linear.

## Best Practices

* Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Factory.
* Use Linear's team-level settings to manage access efficiently.
* Keep your Linear workspace's security settings up-to-date.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration:

* Ensure you have the necessary admin rights on both Factory and Linear.
* Check Linear's audit logs for any permission-related issues.
* Verify that the integration has access to the intended teams and projects.

For persistent problems, contact Factory support with specific error messages or screenshots.
