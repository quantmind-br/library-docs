Factory is an AI-native software development platform that works everywhere you do. From IDE to CI/CD - delegate complete tasks like refactors, incident response, and migrations to Droids without changing your tools, models, or workflow. ![Droid in IDE](https://mintcdn.com/factory/R2VpJ_0BSoOPETrh/images/product-image.png?fit=max&auto=format&n=R2VpJ_0BSoOPETrh&q=85&s=3bec01b1ab88a78e4e21d787ffb089de)

## Why us?

- **Model-agnostic:** use OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, X AI, open-source or local models.
- **Context-confidence:** compresses incrementally with anchor points for near-perfect context.
- **Specification mode:** detailed implementation, technical details and mixed model support.
- **Enterprise-ready:** SSO + SAML, dedicated compute, compliance & security and more.
