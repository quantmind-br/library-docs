Subscription: Team Business

For: Administrators

You can create teams for your organization in the Admin Console or Docker Hub, and configure team repository access in Docker Hub.

A team is a group of Docker users that belong to an organization. An organization can have multiple teams. An organization owner can create new teams and add members to an existing team using their Docker ID or email address. Members aren't required to be part of a team to be associated with an organization.

The organization owner can add additional organization owners to help them manage users, teams, and repositories in the organization by assigning them the owner role.

An organization owner is an administrator who has the following permissions:

- Manage repositories and add team members to the organization
- Access private repositories, all teams, billing information, and organization settings
- Specify [permissions](#permissions-reference) for each team in the organization
- Enable [SSO](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/single-sign-on/) for the organization

When SSO is enabled for your organization, the organization owner can also manage users. Docker can auto-provision Docker IDs for new end-users or users who'd like to have a separate Docker ID for company use through SSO enforcement.

Organization owners can add others with the owner role to help them manage users, teams, and repositories in the organization.

For more information on roles, see [Roles and permissions](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/roles-and-permissions/).

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com) and select your organization.
2. Select **Teams**.

You must create a team before you are able to configure repository permissions. For more details, see [Create and manage a team](https://docs.docker.com/admin/organization/manage-a-team/).

To set team repository permissions:

1. Sign in to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
2. Select **My Hub** &gt; **Repositories**.
   
   A list of your repositories appears.
3. Select a repository.
   
   The **General** page for the repository appears.
4. Select the **Permissions** tab.
5. Add, modify, or remove a team's repository permissions.
   
   - Add: Specify the **Team**, select the **Permission**, and then select **Add**.
   - Modify: Specify the new permission next to the team.
   - Remove: Select the **Remove permission** icon next to the team.

### [Permissions reference](#permissions-reference)

- `Read-only` access lets users view, search, and pull a private repository in the same way as they can a public repository.
- `Read & Write` access lets users pull, push, and view a repository. In addition, it lets users view, cancel, retry or trigger builds.
- `Admin` access lets users pull, push, view, edit, and delete a repository. You can also edit build settings and update the repository’s description, collaborator permissions, public/private visibility, and delete.

Permissions are cumulative. For example, if you have "Read & Write" permissions, you automatically have "Read-only" permissions.

The following table shows what each permission level allows users to do:

ActionRead-onlyRead & WriteAdminPull a Repository✅✅✅View a Repository✅✅✅Push a Repository❌✅✅Edit a Repository❌❌✅Delete a Repository❌❌✅Update a Repository Description❌❌✅View Builds✅✅✅Cancel Builds❌✅✅Retry Builds❌✅✅Trigger Builds❌✅✅Edit Build Settings❌❌✅

> A user who hasn't verified their email address only has `Read-only` access to the repository, regardless of the rights their team membership has given them.

Organization owners can delete a team. When you remove a team from your organization, this action revokes member access to the team's permitted resources. It won't remove users from other teams that they belong to, and it won't delete any resources.

1. Sign in to [Docker Home](https://app.docker.com/) and select your organization.
2. Select **Teams**.
3. Select the **Actions** icon next to the name of the team you want to delete.
4. Select **Delete team**.
5. Review the confirmation message, then select **Delete**.
