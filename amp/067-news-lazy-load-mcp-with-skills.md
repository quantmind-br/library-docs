MCP servers often provide a lot of tools, many of which aren't used. That costs a lot of tokens, because these tool definitions have to be inserted into the context window whether they're used by the agent or not.

As an example: the [chrome-devtools MCP](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp) currently provides 26 tools that together take up 17k tokens; that's 10% of Opus 4.5's context window and 26 tools isn't even a lot for many MCP servers.

To help with that, Amp now allows you to combine MCP server configurations with [Agent Skills](https://ampcode.com/news/agent-skills), allowing the agent to load an MCP server's tool definitions only when the skill is invoked.

## How It Works

Create an `mcp.json` file in the skill definition, next to the `SKILL.md` file, containing the MCP servers and tools you want the agent to load along with the skill:

```
{
	"chrome-devtools": {
		"command": "npx",
		"args": ["-y", "chrome-devtools-mcp@latest"],
		"includeTools": [
			// Tool names or glob patterns
			"navigate_page",
			"take_screenshot",
			"new_page",
			"list_pages"
		]
	}
}
```

At the start of a thread, all the agent will see in the context window is the skill description. When (and if) it then invokes the skill, Amp will append the tool descriptions matching the `includeTools` list to the context window, making them available just in time.

With this specific configuration, instead of loading all 26 tools that `chrome-devtools` provides, we instead load only four tools, **taking up 1.5k tokens instead of 17k**.

Take a look at our [ui-preview skill](https://github.com/ampcode/amp-contrib/tree/main/.agents/skills/ui-preview), that makes use of the `chrome-devtools` MCP, for a full example.
