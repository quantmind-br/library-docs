Allows user to create new conferences in courses and groups.

Allows user to start conferences they created.

### Additional Considerations

To allow full management of conferences created by the user or others, the Course Content permission must also be enabled.

To end a long-running conference, the Course Content permission must be enabled.

If the Course Content permission enabled and Web Conferences - create is disabled, the user can still manage conferences.
