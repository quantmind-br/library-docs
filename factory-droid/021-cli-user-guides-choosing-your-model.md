# Choosing Your Model

> Balance accuracy, speed, and cost by picking the right model and reasoning level for each CLI task.

Model quality evolves quickly, and we tune the CLI defaults as the ecosystem shifts. Use this guide as a snapshot of how the major options compare today, and expect to revisit it as we publish updates. This guide was last updated on Thursday, December 4th 2025.

## 1 · Current stack rank (December 2025)

| Rank | Model                         | Why we reach for it                                                                                                |
| ---- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | **Claude Opus 4.5 (default)** | Highest quality-and-safety balance; current CLI default for both TUI and exec.                                     |
| 2    | **GPT-5.1-Codex-Max**         | Fast coding loops with support up to **Extra High** reasoning; great for heavy implementation and debugging.       |
| 3    | **Claude Sonnet 4.5**         | Strong daily driver with balanced cost/quality; great general-purpose choice when you don’t need Opus-level depth. |
| 4    | **GPT-5.1-Codex**             | Quick iteration with solid code quality at lower cost; bump reasoning when you need more depth.                    |
| 5    | **GPT-5.1**                   | Good generalist, especially when you want OpenAI ergonomics with flexible reasoning effort.                        |
| 6    | **Claude Haiku 4.5**          | Fast, cost-efficient for routine tasks and high-volume automation.                                                 |
| 7    | **Gemini 3 Pro**              | Strong at mixed reasoning with Low/High settings; helpful for researchy flows with structured outputs.             |
| 8    | **Gemini 3 Flash**            | Fast, cheap (0.2× multiplier) with full reasoning support; great for high-volume tasks where speed matters.        |
| 9    | **Droid Core (GLM-4.6)**      | Open-source, 0.25× multiplier, great for bulk automation or air-gapped environments; note: no image support.       |

<Note>
  We ship model updates regularly. When a new release overtakes the list above,
  we update this page and the CLI defaults.

## 2 · Match the model to the job

| Scenario                                                         | Recommended model                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep planning, architecture reviews, ambiguous product specs** | Start with **Opus 4.5 (default)** for depth and safety. Use **Sonnet 4.5** when you want balanced cost/quality, or **Codex/Codex-Max** for faster iteration with reasoning. |
| **Full-feature development, large refactors**                    | **Opus 4.5** for default depth and safety. **GPT-5.1-Codex-Max** when you need speed plus **Extra High** reasoning; **Sonnet 4.5** for balanced loops.                      |
| **Repeatable edits, summarization, boilerplate generation**      | **Haiku 4.5** or **Droid Core** for speed and cost. **GPT-5.1 / GPT-5.1-Codex** when you need higher quality or structured outputs.                                         |
| **CI/CD or automation loops**                                    | Favor **Haiku 4.5** or **Droid Core** for predictable, low-cost throughput. Use **Codex** or **Codex-Max** when automation needs stronger reasoning.                        |
| **High-volume automation, frequent quick turns**                 | **Haiku 4.5** for speedy feedback. **Droid Core** when cost is critical or you need air-gapped deployment.                                                                  |

<Tip>
  **Claude Opus 4.5** is the top-tier option for extremely complex architecture decisions or critical work where you need maximum reasoning capability. Most tasks don't require Opus-level power—start with Sonnet 4.5 and escalate only if needed.
</Tip>

Tip: you can swap models mid-session with `/model` or by toggling in the settings panel (`Shift+Tab` → **Settings**).

## 3 · Switching models mid-session

* Use `/model` (or **Shift+Tab → Settings → Model**) to swap without losing your chat history.
* If you change providers (e.g. Anthropic to OpenAI), the CLI converts the session transcript between Anthropic and OpenAI formats. The translation is lossy—provider-specific metadata is dropped—but we have not seen accuracy regressions in practice.
* For the best context continuity, switch models at natural milestones: after a commit, once a PR lands, or when you abandon a failed approach and reset the plan.
* If you flip back and forth rapidly, expect the assistant to spend a turn re-grounding itself; consider summarizing recent progress when you switch.

## 4 · Reasoning effort settings

* **Opus / Sonnet / Haiku**: Off / Low / Medium / High (default: Off)
* **GPT-5.1**: None / Low / Medium / High (default: None)
* **GPT-5.1-Codex**: Low / Medium / High (default: Medium)
* **GPT-5.1-Codex-Max**: Low / Medium / High / **Extra High** (default: Medium)
* **GPT-5.2**: Low / Medium / High (default: Low)
* **Gemini 3 Pro**: Low / High (default: High)
* **Gemini 3 Flash**: Minimal / Low / Medium / High (default: High)
* **Droid Core (GLM-4.6)**: None only (default: None; no image support)

Reasoning effort increases latency and cost—start low for simple work and escalate as needed. **Extra High** is only available on GPT-5.1-Codex-Max.

<Tip>
  Change reasoning effort from `/model` → **Reasoning effort**, or via the
  settings menu.

## 5 · Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK)

Factory ships with managed Anthropic and OpenAI access. If you prefer to run against your own accounts, BYOK is opt-in—see [Bring Your Own Keys](/cli/configuration/byok) for setup steps, supported providers, and billing notes.

### Open-source models

**Droid Core (GLM-4.6)** is an open-source alternative available in the CLI. It's useful for:

* **Air-gapped environments** where external API calls aren't allowed
* **Cost-sensitive projects** needing unlimited local inference
* **Privacy requirements** where code cannot leave your infrastructure
* **Experimentation** with open-source model capabilities

**Note:** GLM-4.6 does not support image attachments. For image-based workflows, use Claude or GPT models.

To use open-source models, you'll need to configure them via BYOK with a local inference server (like Ollama) or a hosted provider. See [BYOK documentation](/cli/configuration/byok) for setup instructions.

## 6 · Keep notes on what works

* Track high-impact workflows (e.g., spec generation vs. quick edits) and which combinations of model + reasoning effort feel best.
* Ping the community or your Factory contact when you notice a model regression so we can benchmark and update this guidance quickly.
