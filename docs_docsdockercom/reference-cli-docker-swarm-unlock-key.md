DescriptionManage the unlock keyUsage`docker swarm unlock-key [OPTIONS]`

Swarm This command works with the Swarm orchestrator.

## [Description](#description)

An unlock key is a secret key needed to unlock a manager after its Docker daemon restarts. These keys are only used when the autolock feature is enabled for the swarm.

You can view or rotate the unlock key using `swarm unlock-key`. To view the key, run the `docker swarm unlock-key` command without any arguments:

> Note
> 
> This is a cluster management command, and must be executed on a swarm manager node. To learn about managers and workers, refer to the [Swarm mode section](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) in the documentation.

## [Examples](#examples)

```
$ docker swarm unlock-key
To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:
    SWMKEY-1-fySn8TY4w5lKcWcJPIpKufejh9hxx5KYwx6XZigx3Q4
Remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.
```

Use the `--rotate` flag to rotate the unlock key to a new, randomly-generated key:

```
$ docker swarm unlock-key --rotate
Successfully rotated manager unlock key.
To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:
    SWMKEY-1-7c37Cc8654o6p38HnroywCi19pllOnGtbdZEgtKxZu8
Remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.
```

The `-q` (or `--quiet`) flag only prints the key:

```
$ docker swarm unlock-key -q
SWMKEY-1-7c37Cc8654o6p38HnroywCi19pllOnGtbdZEgtKxZu8
```

### [`--rotate`](#rotate)

This flag rotates the unlock key, replacing it with a new randomly-generated key. The old unlock key will no longer be accepted.

### [`--quiet`](#quiet)

Only print the unlock key, without instructions.
