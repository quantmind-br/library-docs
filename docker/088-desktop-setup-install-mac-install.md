> Commercial use of Docker Desktop in larger enterprises (more than 250 employees or more than $10 million USD in annual revenue) requires a [paid subscription](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

This page provides download links, system requirements, and step-by-step installation instructions for Docker Desktop on Mac.

## [System requirements](#system-requirements)

- A supported version of macOS.
  
  > Important
  > 
  > Docker Desktop is supported on the current and two previous major macOS releases. As new major versions of macOS are made generally available, Docker stops supporting the oldest version and supports the newest version of macOS (in addition to the previous two releases).
- At least 4 GB of RAM.

<!--THE END-->

- A supported version of macOS.
  
  > Important
  > 
  > Docker Desktop is supported on the current and two previous major macOS releases. As new major versions of macOS are made generally available, Docker stops supporting the oldest version and supports the newest version of macOS (in addition to the previous two releases).
- At least 4 GB of RAM.
- For the best experience, it's recommended that you install Rosetta 2. Rosetta 2 is no longer strictly required, however there are a few optional command line tools that still require Rosetta 2 when using Darwin/AMD64. See [Known issues](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/troubleshoot/known-issues/). To install Rosetta 2 manually from the command line, run the following command:
  
  ```
  $ softwareupdate --install-rosetta
  ```

> **Before you install or update**
> 
> - Quit tools that might call Docker in the background (Visual Studio Code, terminals, agent apps).
> - If you manage fleets or install via MDM, use the [**PKG installer**](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/enterprise-deployment/pkg-install-and-configure/).
> - Keep the installer volume mounted until the installation completes.
> 
> If you encounter a "Docker.app is damaged" dialog, see [Fix "Docker.app is damaged" on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/troubleshoot/mac-damaged-dialog/).

## [Install and run Docker Desktop on Mac](#install-and-run-docker-desktop-on-mac)

> Tip
> 
> See the [FAQs](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/troubleshoot-and-support/faqs/general/#how-do-I-run-docker-desktop-without-administrator-privileges) on how to install and run Docker Desktop without needing administrator privileges.

### [Install interactively](#install-interactively)

1. Download the installer using the download buttons at the top of the page, or from the [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/).
2. Double-click `Docker.dmg` to open the installer, then drag the Docker icon to the **Applications** folder. By default, Docker Desktop is installed at `/Applications/Docker.app`.
3. Double-click `Docker.app` in the **Applications** folder to start Docker.
4. The Docker menu displays the Docker Subscription Service Agreement.
   
   Here’s a summary of the key points:
   
   - Docker Desktop is free for small businesses (fewer than 250 employees AND less than $10 million in annual revenue), personal use, education, and non-commercial open source projects.
   - Otherwise, it requires a paid subscription for professional use.
   - Paid subscriptions are also required for government entities.
   - Docker Pro, Team, and Business subscriptions include commercial use of Docker Desktop.
5. Select **Accept** to continue.
   
   Note that Docker Desktop won't run if you do not agree to the terms. You can choose to accept the terms at a later date by opening Docker Desktop.
   
   For more information, see [Docker Desktop Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement). It is recommended that you also read the [FAQs](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq).
6. From the installation window, select either:
   
   - **Use recommended settings (Requires password)**. This lets Docker Desktop automatically set the necessary configuration settings.
   - **Use advanced settings**. You can then set the location of the Docker CLI tools either in the system or user directory, enable the default Docker socket, and enable privileged port mapping. See [Settings](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings-and-maintenance/settings/#advanced), for more information and how to set the location of the Docker CLI tools.
7. Select **Finish**. If you have applied any of the previous configurations that require a password in step 6, enter your password to confirm your choice.

### [Install from the command line](#install-from-the-command-line)

After downloading `Docker.dmg` from either the download buttons at the top of the page or from the [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/), run the following commands in a terminal to install Docker Desktop in the **Applications** folder:

```
$ sudo hdiutil attach Docker.dmg
$ sudo /Volumes/Docker/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install
$ sudo hdiutil detach /Volumes/Docker
```

By default, Docker Desktop is installed at `/Applications/Docker.app`. As macOS typically performs security checks the first time an application is used, the `install` command can take several minutes to run.

#### [Installer flags](#installer-flags)

The `install` command accepts the following flags:

##### [Installation behavior](#installation-behavior)

- `--accept-license`: Accepts the [Docker Subscription Service Agreement](https://www.docker.com/legal/docker-subscription-service-agreement) now, rather than requiring it to be accepted when the application is first run.
- `--user=<username>`: Performs the privileged configurations once during installation. This removes the need for the user to grant root privileges on first run. For more information, see [Privileged helper permission requirements](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-permission-requirements/#permission-requirements). To find the username, enter `ls /Users` in the CLI.

##### [Security and access](#security-and-access)

- `--allowed-org=<org name>`: Requires the user to sign in and be part of the specified Docker Hub organization when running the application
- `--user=<username>`: Performs the privileged configurations once during installation. This removes the need for the user to grant root privileges on first run. For more information, see [Privileged helper permission requirements](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-permission-requirements/#permission-requirements). To find the username, enter `ls /Users` in the CLI.
- `--admin-settings`: Automatically creates an `admin-settings.json` file which is used by administrators to control certain Docker Desktop settings on client machines within their organization. For more information, see [Settings Management](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/hardened-desktop/settings-management/).
  
  - It must be used together with the `--allowed-org=<org name>` flag.
  - For example: `--allowed-org=<org name> --admin-settings="{'configurationFileVersion': 2, 'enhancedContainerIsolation': {'value': true, 'locked': false}}"`

##### [Proxy configuration](#proxy-configuration)

- `--proxy-http-mode=<mode>`: Sets the HTTP Proxy mode. The two modes are `system` (default) or `manual`.
- `--override-proxy-http=<URL>`: Sets the URL of the HTTP proxy that must be used for outgoing HTTP requests. It requires `--proxy-http-mode` to be `manual`.
- `--override-proxy-https=<URL>`: Sets the URL of the HTTP proxy that must be used for outgoing HTTPS requests, requires `--proxy-http-mode` to be `manual`
- `--override-proxy-exclude=<hosts/domains>`: Bypasses proxy settings for the hosts and domains. It's a comma-separated list.
- `--override-proxy-pac=<PAC file URL>`: Sets the PAC file URL. This setting takes effect only when using `manual` proxy mode.
- `--override-proxy-embedded-pac=<PAC script>`: Specifies an embedded PAC (Proxy Auto-Config) script. This setting takes effect only when using `manual` proxy mode and has precedence over the `--override-proxy-pac` flag.

###### [Example of specifying PAC file](#example-of-specifying-pac-file)

```
$ sudo /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install --user testuser --proxy-http-mode="manual" --override-proxy-pac="http://localhost:8080/myproxy.pac"
```

###### [Example of specifying PAC script](#example-of-specifying-pac-script)

```
$ sudo /Applications/Docker.app/Contents/MacOS/install --user testuser --proxy-http-mode="manual" --override-proxy-embedded-pac="function FindProxyForURL(url, host) { return \"DIRECT\"; }"
```

> Tip
> 
> As an IT administrator, you can use endpoint management (MDM) software to identify the number of Docker Desktop instances and their versions within your environment. This can provide accurate license reporting, help ensure your machines use the latest version of Docker Desktop, and enable you to [enforce sign-in](https://docs.docker.com/enterprise/security/enforce-sign-in/).
