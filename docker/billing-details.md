You can update the billing information for your personal account or for an organization. When you update your billing information, these changes apply to future billing invoices. The email address you provide for a billing account is where Docker sends all invoices and other billing related communications.

For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

You can update the email address that receives billing invoices at any time.
