### Keep it simple[​](#keep-it-simple "Direct link to Keep it simple")

We write in English for a global audience, and want to make our content accessible to everyone.

- Use short sentences and everyday words that our users understand and use.
- Keep your words direct and to the point.
- Avoid jargon and idioms that may be difficult to understand with no context.
- Make instructions clear, actionable and concise.

### Use active voice[​](#use-active-voice "Direct link to Use active voice")

Active voice eliminates ambiguity.

Example: Branded Moodle App (BMA)

### Use capital letters at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns only.[​](#use-capital-letters-at-the-beginning-of-sentences-and-for-proper-nouns-only "Direct link to Use capital letters at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns only.")

### Avoid regionally specific date formats[​](#avoid-regionally-specific-date-formats "Direct link to Avoid regionally specific date formats")

Don't use 13/02/2022 or 02/13/2022. To avoid confusion, write the date as 13 February 2022.

### Be mindful of length[​](#be-mindful-of-length "Direct link to Be mindful of length")

Translated text is often longer or shorter than your original text in English. This is especially important when writing text for our products. If you have doubts about whether you're compromising the layout or structure, double-check with a designer.

### Avoid using flags to represent languages[​](#avoid-using-flags-to-represent-languages "Direct link to Avoid using flags to represent languages")

Flags represent countries or regions, but not languages: some countries have multiple languages, while many languages are spoken in more than one country. Instead, use the name of the language in its native format followed by its corresponding ISO 639 abbreviation.

> Example: 'Deutsch (de)' for German or '日本語 (ja)' for Japanese.

### Avoid using holiday references[​](#avoid-using-holiday-references "Direct link to Avoid using holiday references")

Holidays are often culture-specific and referencing them can be alienating to people who don't celebrate them.

### Gendered pronouns[​](#gendered-pronouns "Direct link to Gendered pronouns")

Many languages lack gender-inclusive options, like the pronoun "they" in English. When possible, don't use gendered pronouns. Use the "you" pronoun instead of the third person "she/he".

### Gendered adjectives[​](#gendered-adjectives "Direct link to Gendered adjectives")

In many languages, nouns and adjectives are gendered, and finding gendered-inclusive options is difficult. When referring to people, try to avoid adjectives and find a different way of writing what you want to say.

Do

Add the first entry

When the adjective "first" refers to an object, in this case "entry", the translator will automatically use the gender of the object.

Don't

Be the first student to add an entry.

When the adjective "first" refers to a person, in this case a student, in many languages it will need a gender. The translator will have to make a difficult decision.

Avoid using substantivised adjectives too, as they'll also be gendered in many languages. That is, adjectives that act as nouns, for example:

Do

Add the first entry

When the adjective "first" refers to an object, in this case "entry", the translator will automatically use the gender of the object.

Don't

Be the first to add an entry.

The adjective "first" acts like a noun, which means it will need a gender in many languages.
