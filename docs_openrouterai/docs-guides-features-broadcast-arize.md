[Arize AX](https://arize.com) is an evaluation and observability platform developed by Arize AI; it offers tools for agent tracing, evals, prompt optimization, and more.

## Step 1: Get your Arize credentials

In Arize, navigate to your space settings to find your API key and space key:

1. Log in to your Arize account
2. Go to **Space Settings** to find your Space Key
3. Go to **API Keys** to create or copy your API key
4. Note the Model ID you want to use for organizing traces

## Step 2: Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter

Go to [Settings > Observability](https://openrouter.ai/settings/observability) and toggle **Enable Broadcast**.

![Enable Broadcast](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/7386b119bd35a485ec53b6f15e3dfe3a980fc5bf61a573256e27ae607ef5614a/content/pages/features/broadcast/broadcast-enable.png)

## Step 3: Configure Arize AI

Click the edit icon next to **Arize AI** and enter:

* **Api Key**: Your Arize API key
* **Space Key**: Your Arize space key
* **Model Id**: The model identifier for organizing your traces in Arize
* **Base Url** (optional): Default is `https://otlp.arize.com`

## Step 4: Test and save

Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup. The configuration only saves if the test passes.

## Step 5: Send a test trace

Make an API request through OpenRouter and view the trace in your Arize
dashboard under the specified model.

## Custom Metadata

Arize uses the [OpenInference](https://github.com/Arize-ai/openinference) semantic convention for tracing. Custom metadata from the `trace` field is sent as span attributes in the OTLP payload.

### Supported Metadata Keys

| Key               | Arize Mapping  | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `trace_id`        | Trace ID       | Group multiple requests into a single trace      |
| `trace_name`      | Span Name      | Custom name for the root trace                   |
| `span_name`       | Span Name      | Name for intermediate spans in the hierarchy     |
| `generation_name` | Span Name      | Name for the LLM generation span                 |
| `parent_span_id`  | Parent Span ID | Link to an existing span in your trace hierarchy |

### Example

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Classify this text..." }],
  "user": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_abc",
  "trace": {
    "trace_id": "classification_pipeline_001",
    "trace_name": "Text Classification",
    "generation_name": "Classify Sentiment",
    "dataset": "customer_feedback",
    "experiment_id": "exp_v3"
  }
}
```

### Additional Context

* Custom metadata keys from `trace` are included as span attributes under the `metadata.*` namespace
* The `user` field maps to user identification in span attributes
* The `session_id` field maps to session tracking in span attributes
* Token usage, costs, and model parameters are automatically included as OpenInference-compatible attributes

## Privacy Mode

When [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) is enabled for this destination, prompt and completion content is excluded from traces. All other trace data — token usage, costs, timing, model information, and custom metadata — is still sent normally. See [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) for details.
