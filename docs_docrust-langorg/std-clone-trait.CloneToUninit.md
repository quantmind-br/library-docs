## Trait CloneToUninit

[Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/clone.rs.html#507)

```rust
pub unsafe trait CloneToUninit {
    // Required method
    unsafe fn clone_to_uninit(&self, dest: *mut u8);
}
```

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`clone_to_uninit` [#126799](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/126799))

Expand description

A generalization of [`Clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html "trait std::clone::Clone") to [dynamically-sized types](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/dynamically-sized-types.html) stored in arbitrary containers.

This trait is implemented for all types implementing [`Clone`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html "trait std::clone::Clone"), [slices](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html "primitive slice") of all such types, and other dynamically-sized types in the standard library. You may also implement this trait to enable cloning custom DSTs (structures containing dynamically-sized fields), or use it as a supertrait to enable cloning a [trait object](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/types/trait-object.html).

This trait is normally used via operations on container types which support DSTs, so you should not typically need to call `.clone_to_uninit()` explicitly except when implementing such a container or otherwise performing explicit management of an allocation, or when implementing `CloneToUninit` itself.

## [§](#safety)Safety

Implementations must ensure that when `.clone_to_uninit(dest)` returns normally rather than panicking, it always leaves `*dest` initialized as a valid value of type `Self`.

## [§](#examples)Examples

If you are defining a trait, you can add `CloneToUninit` as a supertrait to enable cloning of `dyn` values of your trait:

```rust
#![feature(clone_to_uninit)]
use std::rc::Rc;

trait Foo: std::fmt::Debug + std::clone::CloneToUninit {
    fn modify(&mut self);
    fn value(&self) -> i32;
}

impl Foo for i32 {
    fn modify(&mut self) {
        *self *= 10;
    }
    fn value(&self) -> i32 {
        *self
    }
}

let first: Rc<dyn Foo> = Rc::new(1234);

let mut second = first.clone();
Rc::make_mut(&mut second).modify(); // make_mut() will call clone_to_uninit()

assert_eq!(first.value(), 1234);
assert_eq!(second.value(), 12340);
```

The following is an example of implementing `CloneToUninit` for a custom DST. (It is essentially a limited form of what `derive(CloneToUninit)` would do, if such a derive macro existed.)

```rust
#![feature(clone_to_uninit)]
use std::clone::CloneToUninit;
use std::mem::offset_of;
use std::rc::Rc;

#[derive(PartialEq)]
struct MyDst<T: ?Sized> {
    label: String,
    contents: T,
}

unsafe impl<T: ?Sized + CloneToUninit> CloneToUninit for MyDst<T> {
    unsafe fn clone_to_uninit(&self, dest: *mut u8) {
        // The offset of `self.contents` is dynamic because it depends on the alignment of T
        // which can be dynamic (if `T = dyn SomeTrait`). Therefore, we have to obtain it
        // dynamically by examining `self`, rather than using `offset_of!`.
        //
        // SAFETY: `self` by definition points somewhere before `&self.contents` in the same
        // allocation.
        let offset_of_contents = unsafe {
            (&raw const self.contents).byte_offset_from_unsigned(self)
        };

        // Clone the *sized* fields of `self` (just one, in this example).
        // (By cloning this first and storing it temporarily in a local variable, we avoid
        // leaking it in case of any panic, using the ordinary automatic cleanup of local
        // variables. Such a leak would be sound, but undesirable.)
        let label = self.label.clone();

        // SAFETY: The caller must provide a `dest` such that these field offsets are valid
        // to write to.
        unsafe {
            // Clone the unsized field directly from `self` to `dest`.
            self.contents.clone_to_uninit(dest.add(offset_of_contents));

            // Now write all the sized fields.
            //
            // Note that we only do this once all of the clone() and clone_to_uninit() calls
            // have completed, and therefore we know that there are no more possible panics;
            // this ensures no memory leaks in case of panic.
            dest.add(offset_of!(Self, label)).cast::<String>().write(label);
        }
        // All fields of the struct have been initialized; therefore, the struct is initialized,
        // and we have satisfied our `unsafe impl CloneToUninit` obligations.
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Construct MyDst<[u8; 4]>, then coerce to MyDst<[u8]>.
    let first: Rc<MyDst<[u8]>> = Rc::new(MyDst {
        label: String::from("hello"),
        contents: [1, 2, 3, 4],
    });

    let mut second = first.clone();
    // make_mut() will call clone_to_uninit().
    for elem in Rc::make_mut(&mut second).contents.iter_mut() {
        *elem *= 10;
    }

    assert_eq!(first.contents, [1, 2, 3, 4]);
    assert_eq!(second.contents, [10, 20, 30, 40]);
    assert_eq!(second.label, "hello");
}
```

- [`Clone::clone_from`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html#method.clone_from "method std::clone::Clone::clone_from") is a safe function which may be used instead when [`Self: Sized`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sized.html "trait std::marker::Sized") and the destination is already initialized; it may be able to reuse allocations owned by the destination, whereas `clone_to_uninit` cannot, since its destination is assumed to be uninitialized.
- [`ToOwned`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.ToOwned.html), which allocates a new destination container.

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`clone_to_uninit` [#126799](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/126799))

Performs copy-assignment from `self` to `dest`.

This is analogous to `std::ptr::write(dest.cast(), self.clone())`, except that `Self` may be a dynamically-sized type ([`!Sized`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sized.html "trait std::marker::Sized")).

Before this function is called, `dest` may point to uninitialized memory. After this function is called, `dest` will point to initialized memory; it will be sound to create a `&Self` reference from the pointer with the [pointer metadata](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/fn.metadata.html "fn std::ptr::metadata") from `self`.

##### [§](#safety-1)Safety

Behavior is undefined if any of the following conditions are violated:

- `dest` must be [valid](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/index.html#safety "mod std::ptr") for writes for `size_of_val(self)` bytes.
- `dest` must be properly aligned to `align_of_val(self)`.

##### [§](#panics)Panics

This function may panic. (For example, it might panic if memory allocation for a clone of a value owned by `self` fails.) If the call panics, then `*dest` should be treated as uninitialized memory; it must not be read or dropped, because even if it was previously valid, it may have been partially overwritten.

The caller may wish to take care to deallocate the allocation pointed to by `dest`, if applicable, to avoid a memory leak (but this is not a requirement).

Implementors should avoid leaking values by, upon unwinding, dropping all component values that might have already been created. (For example, if a `[Foo]` of length 3 is being cloned, and the second of the three calls to `Foo::clone()` unwinds, then the first `Foo` cloned should be dropped.)
