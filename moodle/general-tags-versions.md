## [Managing Moodle version documentation](https://moodledev.io/general/documentation/forking-versions)

We generate version-specific documentation and maintain this for each supported version of Moodle.

## [Moodle Versions](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/moodle-versions)

New versions of Moodle are released approximately every six months. Moodle supports upgrading from a previous version. This policy describes how the minimum version to upgrade from is calculated.
