## [Automated code review](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/cibot)

Moodle issues submitted for review and inclusion into core are examined by our continuous integration (ci) system and checked against various automated tests. We use the automated checks to help improve the code quality in Moodle.

Use composer to download Moodle code

## [Development tools](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools)

A range of tools are available to make your life as a Moodle developer easier, and your development faster. These range from editor and IDE integrations, to linting tools which helps your code meet Moodle's Coding style, to build tools essential to the build process.

## [Exception Tracing](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/exceptiontracing)

Exceptions, and errors are a fact of life as a developer, and dealing with them in development should be as easy and painless as possible.

## [Generator tool](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/generator)

## [Moodle Development Kit](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/mdk)

Every developer creates simple tools to avoid repeating cumbersome and/or boring tasks, and that is precisely why MDK has been created: to pack all those useful tools in a portable way across systems. Initially developed in Bash, the project moved to Python to avoid dealing with inconsistencies between Unix platforms, and eventually to support Windows.

## [PHP CodeSniffer](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/phpcs)

PHPCodeSniffer is a tool used to analyse PHP code using a set of rules. In many cases these rules can be used to automatically fix the errors they identify.
