## [Accessibility checklist](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/peer-review/accessibility-checklist)

This document proposes a checklist for accessibility reviews. Not all aspects of accessibility can be checked automatically, so this checklist is intended to guide reviewers when doing an accessibility check to a patch.

## [Backporting](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/backporting)

Whilst we'd all like all Moodle users to be using our latest and greatest code, there is a balance to strike between improving our software and maintaining stability (both in terms of regressions, but also training and documentation materials). Large amounts of change on the stable branches make the lives difficult for institutions to manage upgrades between point releases.

## [Bug triage](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/triage)

Triage is a medical term referring to the process of prioritising patients based on the severity of their condition so as to maximise benefit (help as many as possible) when resources are limited.

## [Component lead review](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/integration/clr)

This document summarises the intent, purpose, and process surrounding component lead reviews (CLR).

## [Component Library](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tools/component-library)

The Component Library is a tool designed for developers to identify frequently used user interface (UI) components and encourage their reuse within Moodle. It includes both components from Twitter Bootstrap and Moodle itself. The library provides an organized display of these components, showcasing them with your current Moodle theme.

## [Contributing](https://moodledev.io/general/community/contribute)

If you want to contribute to Moodle, you can start looking at the following:

## [Deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation)

Deprecation, in its programming sense, is the process of taking older code and marking it as no longer being useful within the codebase, usually because it has been superseded by newer code. The deprecated code is not immediately removed from the codebase because doing so may cause regression errors.

## [Development process](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process)

A summary of the various development processes used in Moodle development.

## [Documentation process](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/release/docsrequiredissues)

Information required

## [Getting started](https://moodledev.io/general/development/gettingstarted)

\- Set up your development environment

## [Icon deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation/icon-deprecation)

Since Moodle 4.5, it's possible to safely deprecate and remove icons.

## [Integration review](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/integration)

All the information related to the integration review process during the Moodle development.

## [Moodle App Development process](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process-moodleapp)

The development of new features and improvements in the Moodle App is organised in the following six phases:

## [Moodle Versions](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/moodle-versions)

New versions of Moodle are released approximately every six months. Moodle supports upgrading from a previous version. This policy describes how the minimum version to upgrade from is calculated.

## [New user docs version process](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/release/newuserdocs)

This page describes the procedures for creating a new Moodle user docs version wiki.

## [Overview](https://moodledev.io/general/community)

This page gives an overview of the process of developing Moodle and outlines some of the basic concepts to better understand this Developer documentation.

## [Peer review](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/peer-review)

All the information related to the peer-reviewing process during the Moodle development.

## [Penetration testing](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/security/penetration-testing)

This is information for people who want to performing a penetration test of their Moodle instance as well as information for pen testers.

## [Plugin Removal](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation/plugin-removal)

We regularly assess the standard plugins that are included in Moodle and will, from time-to-time, remove some of these.

## [QA testing](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/testing/qa)

All the information related to the Qualify Assurance tests during the Moodle development.

## [Release process](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/release)

8 weeks prior

## [SCSS deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation/scss-deprecation)

Since Moodle 4.4, it's possible to deprecate SCSS styles and classes. This allows us to safely remove SCSS and will help us keep the code cleaner and more organized.

## [Security procedures](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/security)

In the Moodle software, security issues are treated very seriously. Even though a lot of time is dedicated designing the code to avoid such problems, it is inevitable in a project of this size that new vulnerabilities will occasionally be discovered.

## [Testing](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/testing)

All the information related to testing during the Moodle development.

## [Testing instructions guide](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/testing/guide)

This page has suggestions for developers on how to write good testing instructions for the weekly testing of integrated issues.

## [Testing of integrated issues](https://moodledev.io/general/development/process/testing/integrated-issues)

All the information related to the integration review process during the Moodle development.

## [Tracker introduction](https://moodledev.io/general/development/tracker)

A summary of the most common actions in Moodle tracker.
