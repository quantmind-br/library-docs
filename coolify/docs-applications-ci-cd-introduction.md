# CI/CD with Git Providers

Applications in Coolify are designed to be deployed directly from **Git repositories**, enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows. This means your applications automatically update when you push code changes to your repository.

## How Git Integration Works

When you deploy an application in Coolify, you connect it to a Git repository from **any Git provider**. Coolify works with all Git platforms, including:

* **[GitHub](/applications/ci-cd/github/integration)** - Full GitHub App integration or deploy keys
* **[GitLab](/applications/ci-cd/gitlab/integration)** - GitLab integration with webhooks
* **[Bitbucket](/applications/ci-cd/bitbucket/integration)** - Bitbucket integration with webhooks
* **[Gitea](/applications/ci-cd/gitea/integration)** - Self-hosted Git platform
* **Any other Git provider** - Works with any Git-compatible platform with publicly accessible repositories or using deploy keys

Once connected, Coolify:

1. **Pulls your source code** from the repository
2. **Builds a Docker image** using your chosen [build pack](/applications/build-packs/overview)
3. **Deploys the container** to your server
4. **Watches for changes** and automatically redeploys when you push new commits (if auto-deploy is enabled)

## Key Benefits of Git-Based Deployments

### Automatic Deployments

Push code to your repository and Coolify automatically builds and deploys your application. No manual intervention needed.

### Preview Deployments

Test pull requests in isolated environments before merging to production. Each PR gets its own unique URL.

### Version Control Integration

* Track deployment history alongside your code commits
* Roll back to previous versions easily
* See exactly what code is running in production

### CI/CD Workflows

* Integrate with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other CI tools
* Run tests before deployment
* Automate complex deployment pipelines

::: tip Alternative: Deploy Without Git
If you want to deploy your own application **without connecting to a Git provider**, you can deploy it as a [Service](/services/introduction) instead. Services allow you to:

* Upload a Docker Compose file directly to Coolify
* Deploy from Docker images without source code
* Manage the application manually without Git integration

This is useful for scenarios where you build your Docker images elsewhere or prefer manual control over deployments.

## Repository Access Methods

Coolify supports multiple ways to access your Git repositories:

### Public Repositories

Simply provide the HTTPS URL of your public repository. No authentication needed. Works with any Git provider.

### Private Repositories

Choose from authentication methods based on your Git provider:

1. **Git Provider App Integration (Recommended for supported providers)**

   * Available for GitHub
   * Full integration with automatic webhooks
   * Pull request deployments
   * Commit status updates
   * No SSH key management

2. **Deploy Keys (Works with any Git provider)**
   * SSH-based authentication
   * Universal support - works with any Git platform
   * More manual webhook setup required
   * Better for air-gapped or restricted environments
   * Ideal for custom or self-hosted Git servers

## Supported Git Providers

While we provide detailed integration guides for popular platforms, **Coolify works with any Git provider** that supports standard Git protocols:

* **Public Repositories**: Any Git provider (no authentication required)
* **With App Integration**: GitHub
* **With Deploy Keys**: Any Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Gitea, Gogs, Forgejo, self-hosted solutions, and more)

## Next Steps

Ready to connect your Git provider? Choose your platform for detailed setup guides:

* **[GitHub Integration](/applications/ci-cd/github/integration)** - Connect GitHub repositories
* **[GitLab Integration](/applications/ci-cd/gitlab/integration)** - Connect GitLab repositories
* **[Bitbucket Integration](/applications/ci-cd/bitbucket/integration)** - Connect Bitbucket repositories
* **[Gitea Integration](/applications/ci-cd/gitea/integration)** - Connect self-hosted Gitea
* **[Other Git Providers](/applications/ci-cd/other-providers)** - Connect Gogs, Forgejo, or any custom Git server
