When upgrading to Moodle 2.1 or 2.2 it was possible to [delay part of the Question engine upgrade](https://docs.moodle.org/21/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.1#Planning_the_question_engine_upgrade). You must complete this upgrade before upgrading to Moodle 2.7. You can check if this was completed at the bottom of the [Environment page](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Environment).

For further information, see the upgrading notes to [complete the Question engine upgrade before Moodle 2.7](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Upgrading#Questions_engine_upgrade).

### Assignment[​](#assignment "Direct link to Assignment")

- [MDL-33952](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-33952) - The old Assignment (2.2) module has been removed from core. It has been replaced by a stub to support transparently remapping urls and restoring course backups from the old module to the new one. If you are still using the old assignment module - all instances of the old assignment module will be hidden after upgrading to Moodle 2.7. Once the upgrade tool is run on those assignments they will become visible again. It is recommended to upgrade, and then convert any remaining assignments because logic has been added to the assignment upgrade code for Moodle 2.7 to transparently map urls from the old assignment module to the new one. If you really, really need to keep using the old module, you should update the code to Moodle 2.7, and then replace the "mod/assignment" folder with the one from [https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-mod\_assignment/releases](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-mod_assignment/releases) before completing the upgrade.
- [MDL-28448](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-28448) - A new capability [mod/assign:editothersubmission](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Capabilities/mod/assign:editothersubmission) can be given to teachers to allow them to edit or delete student submissions.

- [MDL-34432](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-34432) - Teachers can comment directly on students' work on online text assignments
- [MDL-42585](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-42585) - New capability [mod/assign:viewgrades](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Capabilities/mod/assign:viewgrades) to allow grades to be viewed but not changed
- [MDL-44268](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-44268) - Assignment grading table [filters](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Using_Assignment#Filtering_submissions)

### Cron[​](#cron "Direct link to Cron")

- [MDL-25499](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-25499) - Cron has received a major update and now has support for both scheduled and adhoc tasks. The benefits of these changes are:
- The schedule for every task can be configured by the admin
- Tasks can run in parallel
- Cron processes use locking to prevent the same task running at the same time by different processes

A result of this is that cron can be run much more often, which means (for example) forum posts can be sent out sooner. It is now strongly recommended that administrators increase the frequency that cron is run to at least *once per minute*, however it can be kept at it's previous schedule if desired if you do not wish to benefit from these changes.

### Badges[​](#badges "Direct link to Badges")

- New plugin type for conditional availability. See [Availability conditions](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/plugintypes/availability).
- New plugin type for Atto editor. See [Atto](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/plugintypes/atto)
