I'll help you create a cozy campfire scene in Blender. Let's break this down into steps and use a combination of basic objects, textures from PolyHaven, and proper lighting. First, let's check what we're working with.

─── **Get Scene Info** ───

Let's build the scene step by step:

First, let's remove the default cube and set up our ground plane:

─── **Execute Blender Code** ───

2. Now let's create the logs in a circle:

3. Let's create the glowing fireball in the middle:

Let me fix the fireball material:

4. Finally, let's set up the lighting and camera for a dramatic sunset shot:

─── **Execute Blender Code** ───

I've created a cozy campfire scene with the following elements:

1. A large ground plane with a dark brown material
2. 5 logs arranged in a circle, with a rough wood material
3. A glowing fireball in the center with emission material
4. A point light to create the fire's glow effect
5. Adjusted the main sun light to create a warm sunset atmosphere
6. Positioned the camera for a dramatic angle
7. Set up the scene for better rendering with Cycles

The scene has a warm, cozy atmosphere with the logs arranged naturally around the glowing fireball. The lighting simulates a sunset with warm tones, and the camera is positioned to capture the scene from an interesting angle.

If you'd like to make any adjustments, such as:

- Changing the size or position of any elements
- Adjusting the lighting intensity
- Modifying the camera angle
- Adding more details like small rocks or additional logs

Just let me know and I'll help you refine the scene further!
