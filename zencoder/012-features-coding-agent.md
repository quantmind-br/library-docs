## What is the Coding Agent?

The Coding Agent is Zencoder’s primary development tool that generates, modifies, and refactors code across multiple files and languages. It leverages [Repo Grokking™](https://docs.zencoder.ai/technologies/repo-grokking) for deep codebase understanding and the [Agentic Pipeline](https://docs.zencoder.ai/technologies/agentic-pipeline) for validation and error correction, enabling complex development tasks from a single prompt.

## Accessing the Coding Agent

To access the Coding Agent’s powerful capabilities:

1. Open the [agent selector](https://docs.zencoder.ai/features/agents-overview#accessing-agents) with `Cmd+.` (Mac) or `Ctrl+.` (Windows/Linux)
2. Select `Coding` from the dropdown menu
3. The Coding Agent can perform complex tasks like:
   
   - Creating and modifying multiple files
   - Implementing entire features
   - Searching the web for documentation
   - Running validation and tests
