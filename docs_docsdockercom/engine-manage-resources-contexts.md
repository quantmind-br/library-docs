This guide shows how you can use contexts to manage Docker daemons from a single client.

Each context contains all information required to manage resources on the daemon. The `docker context` command makes it easy to configure these contexts and switch between them.

As an example, a single Docker client might be configured with two contexts:

- A default context running locally
- A remote, shared context

Once these contexts are configured, you can use the `docker context use <context-name>` command to switch between them.

To follow the examples in this guide, you'll need:

- A Docker client that supports the top-level `context` command

Run `docker context` to verify that your Docker client supports contexts.

## [The anatomy of a context](#the-anatomy-of-a-context)

A context is a combination of several properties. These include:

- Name and description
- Endpoint configuration
- TLS info

To list available contexts, use the `docker context ls` command.

This shows a single context called "default". It's configured to talk to a daemon through the local `/var/run/docker.sock` Unix socket.

The asterisk in the `NAME` column indicates that this is the active context. This means all `docker` commands run against this context, unless overridden with environment variables such as `DOCKER_HOST` and `DOCKER_CONTEXT`, or on the command-line with the `--context` and `--host` flags.

Dig a bit deeper with `docker context inspect`. The following example shows how to inspect the context called `default`.

### [Create a new context](#create-a-new-context)

You can create new contexts with the `docker context create` command.

The following example creates a new context called `docker-test` and specifies the host endpoint of the context to TCP socket `tcp://docker:2375`.

The new context is stored in a `meta.json` file below `~/.docker/contexts/`. Each new context you create gets its own `meta.json` stored in a dedicated sub-directory of `~/.docker/contexts/`.

You can view the new context with `docker context ls` and `docker context inspect <context-name>`.

The current context is indicated with an asterisk ("\*").

## [Use a different context](#use-a-different-context)

You can use `docker context use` to switch between contexts.

The following command will switch the `docker` CLI to use the `docker-test` context.

Verify the operation by listing all contexts and ensuring the asterisk ("\*") is against the `docker-test` context.

`docker` commands will now target endpoints defined in the `docker-test` context.

You can also set the current context using the `DOCKER_CONTEXT` environment variable. The environment variable overrides the context set with `docker context use`.

Use the appropriate command below to set the context to `docker-test` using an environment variable.

Run `docker context ls` to verify that the `docker-test` context is now the active context.

You can also use the global `--context` flag to override the context. The following command uses a context called `production`.

## [Exporting and importing Docker contexts](#exporting-and-importing-docker-contexts)

You can use the `docker context export` and `docker context import` commands to export and import contexts on different hosts.

The `docker context export` command exports an existing context to a file. The file can be imported on any host that has the `docker` client installed.

### [Exporting and importing a context](#exporting-and-importing-a-context)

The following example exports an existing context called `docker-test`. It will be written to a file called `docker-test.dockercontext`.

Check the contents of the export file.

Import this file on another host using `docker context import` to create context with the same configuration.

You can verify that the context was imported with `docker context ls`.

The format of the import command is `docker context import <context-name> <context-file>`.

## [Updating a context](#updating-a-context)

You can use `docker context update` to update fields in an existing context.

The following example updates the description field in the existing `docker-test` context.
