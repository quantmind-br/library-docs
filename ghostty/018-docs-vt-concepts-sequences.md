Control sequences are a way for programs to interact with the terminal.

Control sequences are used to do things like move the cursor, change text color, clear the screen, and more. They are the primary way that programs interact with the terminal.

Programs running within terminals only have a single way to communicate with the terminal: writing bytes to the connected file descriptor (typically a pseudo-terminal, or a "pty" for short). In order to differentiate between text to be displayed and commands to be executed, terminals use special syntax known collectively as **control sequences**.

Each type of control sequence has a different format and purpose. They are described below along with their specific syntax. The [reference](https://ghostty.org/docs/vt/reference) contains a full list of supported control sequences grouped by type.

Each control sequence starts with a special, unprintable character, known as a **control character**. The simplest control characters, known as **C0 control characters**, lie between `0x00` and `0x20` in the ASCII encoding and take no parameters other than themselves.

There are very few control characters, but they're important to be aware of because the single byte value impacts the terminal state.

C0 characters meaningful to terminal emulation include:

One of the C0 characters, Escape (`0x1b`, `ESC`), is special. It can either start a few discrete sequences or begin entire families of sequences, which is also why control sequences are also *pars pro toto* commonly known as **escape sequences**.

Not all sequences that begin with Escape are Escape sequences as defined here (they are more likely to be [C1 sequences](#c1-sequences)), but a true Escape sequence like `ESC D` are in the format below.

```
esc_sequence = "0x1B" intermediates final
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x30-0x7E]
```

When Escape is followed by certain printable characters, for various historical reasons they are instead interpreted together as **C1 control characters**, some of which are responsible for many families of sequences known collectively as `Fe` sequences. These characters can also be represented by single 8-bit characters, but they remain **predominantly** encoded with Escape characters as to avoid conflicting with UTF-8 and other high-byte encodings usually used in modern terminals.

CSI sequences are *by far* the most common type of C1 sequences. They use integer parameters separated either with colons (`:`) or semicolons (`;`) to move the cursor, set the terminal's mode, scroll up or down, insert and delete cells and lines, change the styles of cells, etc.

Their primary limitation is that they can **only** encode integer values. Other sequence types such as OSC or DCS are needed to encode string data.

CSI sequences follow the format below. An example CSI sequence is `ESC [ 1 ; 2 m`.

```
csi_sequence = "0x1B" "[" params intermediates final
params = param | param sep params
param = [0-9]
sep = ";" | ":"
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x40-0x7E]
```

OSC sequences are typically used to encode strings or other non-integer data to transmit between the terminal and an application. They usually alter variables regarding the terminal emulator itself, such as its title, palette, clipboard, etc., or instruct it on extra features like hyperlinks, progress reports, the current working directory, and so on.

As a result of its flexibility, OSC sequences are very often used by modern extensions to offer new functionality that older terminals can simply ignore.

An OSC sequence begins with OSC (`ESC ]` or `0x9d`). Then, by convention, an integer is added to identify the operation

The format of an OSC sequence is below. By convention, OSC sequences are identified by an integer identifier followed by a semicolon (`;`), although this is never required by the standard. Certain obsolete OSC sequences use non-numeric identifiers before the semicolon, but Ghostty does not support

> Due to yet more convoluted historical reasons, OSC sequences in xterm (and by extension Ghostty) may be terminated with the Bell character (`BEL`, `0x07`) instead of the standard String Terminator (`ST`, `ESC \` or `0x9c`).

> While they are in most cases interchangeable, Ghostty will try to echo back the terminator used in an OSC sequence when replying, to ensure maximum compatibility with older programs and terminals. New code should always prefer `ST` due to standards compliance.

them. An example OSC sequence is `OSC 2 ; 👻 Ghostty 👻 ST` (where `ST` is the String Terminator).

```
osc_sequence = "0x1B" "]" data terminator
data = [0x20-0xFF]
terminator = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```

DCS Sequences are like a CSI sequence combined with an OSC sequence: they natively support integer parameters as well as string values. An example DSC sequence is `DCS + P q <string> ST`

```
dsc_sequence = "0x1B" "P" params intermediates final data ST
params = param | param ";" params
param = [0-9]
intermediates = [0x20-0x2F]*
final = [0x40-0x7E]
data = [0x20-0xFF]
ST = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```

Ghostty supports APC sequences. Currently there is only one supported APC sequence: the Kitty Graphics Protocol sequence. This is documented [here](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/).

```
apc_sequence = "0x1B" "_" data ST
data = [0x20-0xFF]
ST = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```

SOS and PM sequences are entirely ignored by Ghostty.

```
sos_sequence = "0x1B" "X" data ST
pm_sequence = "0x1B" "^" data ST
data = [0x20-0xFF]
ST = "0x1B" "0x5C"
```
