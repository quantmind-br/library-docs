## [Data definition API](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/core/dml/ddl)

In this page you'll access to the available functions under Moodle to be able to handle DB structures (tables, fields, indexes...).

## [Data manipulation API](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/core/dml)

This page describes the functions available to access data in the Moodle database. You should exclusively use these functions in order to retrieve or modify database content because these functions provide a high level of abstraction and guarantee that your database manipulation will work against different RDBMSes.

## [Database schema](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/core/dml/database-schema)

The files available here are in DBDesigner4 format. DBDesigner4 is a schema drawing program released under GPL.

## [DML exceptions](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/apis/core/dml/exceptions)

The DML API uses a selection of exceptions to indicate errors.
