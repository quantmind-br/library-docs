## New Quizzes - view multi session information

This permission allows users to view multi-session activity information on the activity log and the moderate page.

### Additional Considerations

Educators can enable the Detect Multiple Sessions setting on their quizzes to collect multi-session information on student submissions. This permission determines who can view this data in the activity log and moderate page.
