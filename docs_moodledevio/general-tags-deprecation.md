## [Deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation)

Deprecation, in its programming sense, is the process of taking older code and marking it as no longer being useful within the codebase, usually because it has been superseded by newer code. The deprecated code is not immediately removed from the codebase because doing so may cause regression errors.

## [Icon deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation/icon-deprecation)

Since Moodle 4.5, it's possible to safely deprecate and remove icons.

## [Plugin Removal](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation/plugin-removal)

We regularly assess the standard plugins that are included in Moodle and will, from time-to-time, remove some of these.

## [SCSS deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation/scss-deprecation)

Since Moodle 4.4, it's possible to deprecate SCSS styles and classes. This allows us to safely remove SCSS and will help us keep the code cleaner and more organized.

## [String deprecation](https://moodledev.io/general/projects/api/string-deprecation)
