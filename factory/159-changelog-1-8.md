Factory 1.8 introduces Droid Exec, a headless execution mode for automation workflows, plus revamped Slack and Linear integrations that let you delegate complete tasks without leaving your collaboration tools.

## Droid Exec: Headless CLI mode

Automate repetitive tasks at scale. Droid Exec is a one-shot command designed for CI/CD pipelines, shell scripts, and batch processing. **How it works** Run Droid Exec directly from the command line with configurable autonomy levels and output formats (including JSON). The command processes tasks concurrently with robust error handling—if one file fails, the batch continues. **Use cases**

- Refactor code patterns across hundreds of files
- Generate or update tests in bulk
- Update dependencies project-wide
- Enforce coding standards across codebases
- Improve error messages and documentation

**Example**: Search for error instantiations across a codebase and improve messages using concurrent Droid Exec commands, processing up to 5 files at once.

## Slack integration

Delegate incidents and tasks directly from Slack threads. @mention Factory in any incident thread to spin up a headless session with full context. **How it works**

1. @mention Factory in a Slack thread
2. Select your workspace if prompted
3. Factory starts a Droid session and drops a live session link in the thread
4. Your team can track progress in real-time

Perfect for incident response, debugging, and collaborative problem-solving without context switching.

## Linear integration

Assign Factory to Linear issues and let Droids work through tickets autonomously. Progress updates are posted directly back to Linear, keeping your team in sync. **How it works**

1. Set Factory as the assignee on a Linear issue
2. Droid accesses full context of your code and conversation
3. As Droid makes progress, updates are posted back to Linear
4. Your team stays informed without manual check-ins

## Sentry + Linear workflow

Take incident response workflows a step farther. Assign a ticket to Sentry to RCA an issue, then assign the fix to Factory. Full observability-to-resolution pipeline without leaving your tools.

## Droids everywhere

Droids work everywhere you go—from IDE to CI/CD to collaboration tools. Delegate incident response, migrations, and complete development tasks to Droids without changing your tools, models, or workflows. Factory ranks as the world’s leading coding agent on Terminal Bench, bringing agent-native development to your entire stack.
