## [Enrolment API](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/subsystems/enrol)

The enrolment API gives access to the enrolment methods and also to enrolment plugins instances.

## [Enrolment plugins](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/plugintypes/enrol)

Moodle provides a number of ways of managing course enrolment, called enrolment plugins. Each course can decide its enabled enrolment plugins instances and any enrolment plugin can define a workflow the user must follow in order to enrol in the course.
