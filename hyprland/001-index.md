Hello there, dear traveler! Welcome to the Hyprland Wiki!

Take a tour of the pages on the left and read ones that you may need.

***This wiki is versioned!*** By default, you are reading the wiki for *the latest Hyprland git commit*. Click on the version selector and select your version if you are running a tagged release (which you very likely are, you can check with `hyprctl version`).

## Wayland info (especially useful for Xorg users)[](#wayland-info-especially-useful-for-xorg-users)

A Wayland compositor is a fully autonomous Display Server, like Xorg itself. It is **not** possible to mix’n’match Wayland compositors like you could on Xorg with window managers and compositors. It is also not entirely possible, nor recommended, to try and use all Xorg applications on Wayland. See [this page](https://wiki.hypr.land/Useful-Utilities/) for a list of recommended Wayland native/compatible programs.

Wayland **compositors** should not be confused with Xorg **window managers**.
