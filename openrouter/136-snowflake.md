[Snowflake](https://snowflake.com) is a cloud data warehouse platform. OpenRouter can stream traces directly to your Snowflake database for custom analytics, long-term storage, and business intelligence.

## Step 1: Create the traces table

Before connecting OpenRouter, create the `OPENROUTER_TRACES` table in your Snowflake database. You can find the exact SQL in the OpenRouter dashboard when configuring the destination:

![Snowflake Table Setup](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/db3ff2b0530882403aeb9f9eaba5ca71e222c9b8c10f525c6177e677fa576c56/content/pages/features/broadcast/snowflake-table-setup.png)

## Step 2: Create access credentials

Generate a [Programmatic Access Token](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/programmatic-access-tokens) with `ACCOUNTADMIN` permissions in the Snowflake UI under **Settings > Authentication**.

![Snowflake PAT](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/eead64d1e537b198567e1ce337babdb22cfa6c0f102856b4dd69355f10e74ed6/content/pages/features/broadcast/snowflake-pat.png)

## Step 3: Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter

Go to [Settings > Observability](https://openrouter.ai/settings/observability) and toggle **Enable Broadcast**.

![Enable Broadcast](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/7386b119bd35a485ec53b6f15e3dfe3a980fc5bf61a573256e27ae607ef5614a/content/pages/features/broadcast/broadcast-enable.png)

## Step 4: Configure Snowflake

Click the edit icon next to **Snowflake** and enter:

* **Account**: Your Snowflake account identifier (e.g., `eac52885.us-east-1`). You can find your account region and your account number at the end of your Snowflake instance's URL: [https://app.snowflake.com/us-east-1/eac52885](https://app.snowflake.com/us-east-1/eac52885); together these make your account identifier.
* **Token**: Your Programmatic Access Token.
* **Database**: Target database name (default: `SNOWFLAKE_LEARNING_DB`).
* **Schema**: Target schema name (default: `PUBLIC`).
* **Table**: Table name (default: `OPENROUTER_TRACES`).
* **Warehouse**: Compute warehouse name (default: `COMPUTE_WH`).

## Step 5: Test and save

Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup. The configuration only saves if the test passes.

## Step 6: Send a test trace

Make an API request through OpenRouter and query your Snowflake table to verify the trace was received.

![Snowflake Test Trace](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/d6fd2cb5005ff249fbc228889402a09c81ee584bbd9cd00aa5fc59ccfa4a4fa5/content/pages/features/broadcast/snowflake-test-trace.png)

## Example queries

### Cost analysis by model

```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('day', TIMESTAMP) as day,
  MODEL,
  SUM(TOTAL_COST) as total_cost,
  SUM(TOTAL_TOKENS) as total_tokens,
  COUNT(*) as request_count
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND STATUS = 'ok'
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY day, MODEL
ORDER BY day DESC, total_cost DESC;
```

### User activity analysis

```sql
SELECT
  USER_ID,
  COUNT(DISTINCT TRACE_ID) as trace_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT SESSION_ID) as session_count,
  SUM(TOTAL_TOKENS) as total_tokens,
  SUM(TOTAL_COST) as total_cost,
  AVG(DURATION_MS) as avg_duration_ms
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY USER_ID
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

### Error analysis

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  TIMESTAMP,
  MODEL,
  LEVEL,
  FINISH_REASON,
  METADATA as user_metadata,
  INPUT,
  OUTPUT
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE STATUS = 'error'
  AND TIMESTAMP >= DATEADD(hour, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC;
```

### Provider performance comparison

```sql
SELECT
  PROVIDER_NAME,
  MODEL,
  AVG(DURATION_MS) as avg_duration_ms,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY DURATION_MS) as p50_duration_ms,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.95) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY DURATION_MS) as p95_duration_ms,
  COUNT(*) as request_count
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND STATUS = 'ok'
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY PROVIDER_NAME, MODEL
HAVING request_count >= 10
ORDER BY avg_duration_ms;
```

### Usage by API key

```sql
SELECT
  API_KEY_NAME,
  COUNT(DISTINCT TRACE_ID) as trace_count,
  SUM(TOTAL_COST) as total_cost,
  SUM(PROMPT_TOKENS) as prompt_tokens,
  SUM(COMPLETION_TOKENS) as completion_tokens
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE TIMESTAMP >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
GROUP BY API_KEY_NAME
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
```

### Accessing VARIANT columns

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  METADATA:custom_field::STRING as custom_value,
  ATTRIBUTES:"gen_ai.request.model"::STRING as requested_model
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE METADATA:custom_field IS NOT NULL;
```

### Parsing input messages

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  INPUT:messages[0]:role::STRING as first_message_role,
  INPUT:messages[0]:content::STRING as first_message_content
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION';
```

## Schema design

### Typed columns

The schema extracts commonly-queried fields as typed columns for efficient filtering and aggregation:

* **Identifiers**: TRACE\_ID, USER\_ID, SESSION\_ID, etc.
* **Timestamps**: For time-series analysis
* **Model Info**: For cost and performance analysis
* **Metrics**: Tokens and costs for billing

### VARIANT columns

Less commonly-accessed and variable-structure data is stored in VARIANT columns:

* **ATTRIBUTES**: Full OTEL attribute set
* **INPUT/OUTPUT**: Variable message structures
* **METADATA**: User-defined key-values
* **MODEL\_PARAMETERS**: Model-specific configurations

This design balances query performance with schema flexibility and storage efficiency.

## Custom Metadata

Custom metadata from the `trace` field is stored in the `METADATA` VARIANT column. You can query it using Snowflake's semi-structured data functions.

### Supported Metadata Keys

| Key               | Snowflake Mapping                       | Description                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `trace_id`        | `TRACE_ID` column / `METADATA:trace_id` | Custom trace identifier for grouping |
| `trace_name`      | `METADATA:trace_name`                   | Custom name for the trace            |
| `span_name`       | `METADATA:span_name`                    | Name for intermediate spans          |
| `generation_name` | `METADATA:generation_name`              | Name for the LLM generation          |

### Example

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Forecast next quarter revenue..." }],
  "user": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_abc",
  "trace": {
    "trace_name": "Revenue Forecasting",
    "generation_name": "Generate Forecast",
    "department": "finance",
    "quarter": "Q2-2026",
    "model_version": "v3"
  }
}
```

### Querying Custom Metadata

Use Snowflake's VARIANT column syntax to query your custom metadata:

```sql
SELECT
  TRACE_ID,
  METADATA:department::STRING as department,
  METADATA:quarter::STRING as quarter,
  METADATA:model_version::STRING as model_version,
  TOTAL_COST,
  TOTAL_TOKENS
FROM OPENROUTER_TRACES
WHERE METADATA:department IS NOT NULL
  AND SPAN_TYPE = 'GENERATION'
ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC;
```

### Additional Context

* The `user` field maps to the `USER_ID` typed column
* The `session_id` field maps to the `SESSION_ID` typed column
* All custom metadata keys from `trace` are stored in the `METADATA` VARIANT column for flexible querying
* You can create materialized views on frequently queried metadata fields for better performance

## Privacy Mode

When [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) is enabled for this destination, prompt and completion content is excluded from traces. All other trace data — token usage, costs, timing, model information, and custom metadata — is still sent normally. See [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) for details.
