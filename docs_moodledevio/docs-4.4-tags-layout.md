## [Layout](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.4/apis/plugintypes/theme/layout)

All themes are required to define the layouts they wish to be responsible for as well as create; however, many layout files are required by those layouts. If the theme is overriding another theme then it is a case of deciding which layouts this new theme should override. If the theme is a completely fresh start then you will need to define a layout for each of the different possibilities.
