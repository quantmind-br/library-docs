## Outcome Proficiency Calculations - add / edit

Allows user to view the Outcomes Calculations tab and set outcome proficiency calculations at the account and course levels.

### Additional Considerations

This permission requires the Account and Course Level Outcome Mastery Scales feature option, which must be enabled by a Customer Success Manager.

This feature affects existing data for an entire account.

If the feature option is enabled, and this permission is enabled, the Outcomes page includes three tabs: Manage, Mastery, and Calculation.

To access the Mastery tab, the Outcome Mastery Scales - add / edit permission must also be enabled. To access the Manage tab, the Learning Outcomes - add / edit / delete permission must also be enabled.

If this permission is enabled, the Learning Mastery tab displays on the Outcomes page instead of the Rubrics page.
