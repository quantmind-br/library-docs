## Submission - Submit on behalf of student

Allows instructors to submit file attachments on behalf of a student.

### Additional Considerations

Once enabled, this option is visible in gradebook for instructors.

Instructors are not bound by attempt limits, but an instructor's submission WILL count as a student's attempt.
