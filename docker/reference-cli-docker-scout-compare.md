DescriptionCompare two images and display differences (experimental)Usage`docker scout compare --to IMAGE|DIRECTORY|ARCHIVE [IMAGE|DIRECTORY|ARCHIVE]`Aliases

An alias is a short or memorable alternative for a longer command.

`docker scout diff`

**Experimental**

**This command is experimental.**

Experimental features are intended for testing and feedback as their functionality or design may change between releases without warning or can be removed entirely in a future release.

## [Description](#description)

The `docker scout compare` command analyzes two images and displays a comparison.

> This command is **experimental** and its behaviour might change in the future

The intended use of this command is to compare two versions of the same image. For instance, when a new image is built and compared to the version running in production.

If no image is specified, the most recently built image is used as a comparison target.

The following artifact types are supported:

- Images
- OCI layout directories
- Tarball archives, as created by `docker save`
- Local directory or file

By default, the tool expects an image reference, such as:

- `redis`
- `curlimages/curl:7.87.0`
- `mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime:7.0`

If the artifact you want to analyze is an OCI directory, a tarball archive, a local file or directory, or if you want to control from where the image will be resolved, you must prefix the reference with one of the following:

- `image://` (default) use a local image, or fall back to a registry lookup
- `local://` use an image from the local image store (don't do a registry lookup)
- `registry://` use an image from a registry (don't use a local image)
- `oci-dir://` use an OCI layout directory
- `archive://` use a tarball archive, as created by `docker save`
- `fs://` use a local directory or file
- `sbom://` SPDX file or in-toto attestation file with SPDX predicate or `syft` json SBOM file
