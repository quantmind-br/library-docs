## [Command-line Arguments](#command-line-arguments)

Here’s a list of command-line arguments to `rustc` and what they do.

## [`-h`/`--help`: get help](#-h--help-get-help)

This flag will print out help information for `rustc`.

## [`--cfg`: configure the compilation environment](#--cfg-configure-the-compilation-environment)

This flag can turn on or off various `#[cfg]` settings for [conditional compilation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html).

The value can either be a single identifier or two identifiers separated by `=`.

For examples, `--cfg 'verbose'` or `--cfg 'feature="serde"'`. These correspond to `#[cfg(verbose)]` and `#[cfg(feature = "serde")]` respectively.

## [`--check-cfg`: configure compile-time checking of conditional compilation](#--check-cfg-configure-compile-time-checking-of-conditional-compilation)

This flag enables checking conditional configurations of the crate at compile-time, specifically it helps configure the set of expected cfg names and values, in order to check that every *reachable* `#[cfg]` matches the expected config names and values.

This is different from the `--cfg` flag above which activates some config but do not expect them. This is useful to prevent stalled conditions, typos, …

Refer to the [Checking conditional configurations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/check-cfg.html) of this book for further details and explanation.

For examples, `--check-cfg 'cfg(verbose)'` or `--check-cfg 'cfg(feature, values("serde"))'`. These correspond to `#[cfg(verbose)]` and `#[cfg(feature = "serde")]` respectively.

## [`-L`: add a directory to the library search path](#-l-add-a-directory-to-the-library-search-path)

The `-L` flag adds a path to search for external crates and libraries.

The kind of search path can optionally be specified with the form `-L KIND=PATH` where `KIND` may be one of:

- `dependency` — Only search for transitive dependencies in this directory.
- `crate` — Only search for this crate’s direct dependencies in this directory.
- `native` — Only search for native libraries in this directory.
- `framework` — Only search for macOS frameworks in this directory.
- `all` — Search for all library kinds in this directory, except frameworks. This is the default if `KIND` is not specified.

## [`-l`: link the generated crate to a native library](#-l-link-the-generated-crate-to-a-native-library)

Syntax: `-l [KIND[:MODIFIERS]=]NAME[:RENAME]`.

This flag allows you to specify linking to a specific native library when building a crate.

The kind of library can optionally be specified with the form `-l KIND=lib` where `KIND` may be one of:

- `dylib` — A native dynamic library.
- `static` — A native static library (such as a `.a` archive).
- `framework` — A macOS framework.

If the kind is specified, then linking modifiers can be attached to it. Modifiers are specified as a comma-delimited string with each modifier prefixed with either a `+` or `-` to indicate that the modifier is enabled or disabled, respectively. Specifying multiple `modifiers` arguments in a single `link` attribute, or multiple identical modifiers in the same `modifiers` argument is not currently supported.  
Example: `-l static:+whole-archive=mylib`.

The kind of library and the modifiers can also be specified in a [`#[link]` attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/external-blocks.html#the-link-attribute). If the kind is not specified in the `link` attribute or on the command-line, it will link a dynamic library by default, except when building a static executable. If the kind is specified on the command-line, it will override the kind specified in a `link` attribute.

The name used in a `link` attribute may be overridden using the form `-l ATTR_NAME:LINK_NAME` where `ATTR_NAME` is the name in the `link` attribute, and `LINK_NAME` is the name of the actual library that will be linked.

### [Linking modifiers: `whole-archive`](#linking-modifiers-whole-archive)

This modifier is only compatible with the `static` linking kind. Using any other kind will result in a compiler error.

`+whole-archive` means that the static library is linked as a whole archive without throwing any object files away.

This modifier translates to `--whole-archive` for `ld`-like linkers, to `/WHOLEARCHIVE` for `link.exe`, and to `-force_load` for `ld64`. The modifier does nothing for linkers that don’t support it.

The default for this modifier is `-whole-archive`.

### [Linking modifiers: `bundle`](#linking-modifiers-bundle)

This modifier is only compatible with the `static` linking kind. Using any other kind will result in a compiler error.

When building a rlib or staticlib `+bundle` means that the native static library will be packed into the rlib or staticlib archive, and then retrieved from there during linking of the final binary.

When building a rlib `-bundle` means that the native static library is registered as a dependency of that rlib “by name”, and object files from it are included only during linking of the final binary, the file search by that name is also performed during final linking.  
When building a staticlib `-bundle` means that the native static library is simply not included into the archive and some higher level build system will need to add it later during linking of the final binary.

This modifier has no effect when building other targets like executables or dynamic libraries.

The default for this modifier is `+bundle`.

### [Linking modifiers: `verbatim`](#linking-modifiers-verbatim)

This modifier is compatible with all linking kinds.

`+verbatim` means that rustc itself won’t add any target-specified library prefixes or suffixes (like `lib` or `.a`) to the library name, and will try its best to ask for the same thing from the linker.

For `ld`-like linkers supporting GNU extensions rustc will use the `-l:filename` syntax (note the colon) when passing the library, so the linker won’t add any prefixes or suffixes to it. See [`-l namespec`](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Options.html) in ld documentation for more details.  
For linkers not supporting any verbatim modifiers (e.g. `link.exe` or `ld64`) the library name will be passed as is. So the most reliable cross-platform use scenarios for this option are when no linker is involved, for example bundling native libraries into rlibs.

`-verbatim` means that rustc will either add a target-specific prefix and suffix to the library name before passing it to linker, or won’t prevent linker from implicitly adding it.  
In case of `raw-dylib` kind in particular `.dll` will be added to the library name on Windows.

The default for this modifier is `-verbatim`.

NOTE: Even with `+verbatim` and `-l:filename` syntax `ld`-like linkers do not typically support passing absolute paths to libraries. Usually such paths need to be passed as input files without using any options like `-l`, e.g. `ld /my/absolute/path`.  
`-Clink-arg=/my/absolute/path` can be used for doing this from stable `rustc`.

## [`--crate-type`: a list of types of crates for the compiler to emit](#--crate-type-a-list-of-types-of-crates-for-the-compiler-to-emit)

This instructs `rustc` on which crate type to build. This flag accepts a comma-separated list of values, and may be specified multiple times. The valid crate types are:

- `lib` — Generates a library kind preferred by the compiler, currently defaults to `rlib`.
- `rlib` — A Rust static library.
- `staticlib` — A native static library.
- `dylib` — A Rust dynamic library.
- `cdylib` — A native dynamic library.
- `bin` — A runnable executable program.
- `proc-macro` — Generates a format suitable for a procedural macro library that may be loaded by the compiler.

The crate type may be specified with the [`crate_type` attribute](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html). The `--crate-type` command-line value will override the `crate_type` attribute.

More details may be found in the [linkage chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/linkage.html) of the reference.

## [`--crate-name`: specify the name of the crate being built](#--crate-name-specify-the-name-of-the-crate-being-built)

This informs `rustc` of the name of your crate.

## [`--edition`: specify the edition to use](#--edition-specify-the-edition-to-use)

This flag takes a value of `2015`, `2018`,`2021`, or `2024`. The default is `2015`. More information about editions may be found in the [edition guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/introduction.html).

## [`--emit`: specifies the types of output files to generate](#--emit-specifies-the-types-of-output-files-to-generate)

This flag controls the types of output files generated by the compiler. It accepts a comma-separated list of values, and may be specified multiple times. The valid emit kinds are:

- `asm` — Generates a file with the crate’s assembly code. The default output filename is `CRATE_NAME.s`.
- `dep-info` — Generates a file with Makefile syntax that indicates all the source files that were loaded to generate the crate. The default output filename is `CRATE_NAME.d`.
- `link` — Generates the crates specified by `--crate-type`. The default output filenames depend on the crate type and platform. This is the default if `--emit` is not specified.
- `llvm-bc` — Generates a binary file containing the [LLVM bitcode](https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html). The default output filename is `CRATE_NAME.bc`.
- `llvm-ir` — Generates a file containing [LLVM IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html). The default output filename is `CRATE_NAME.ll`.
- `metadata` — Generates a file containing metadata about the crate. The default output filename is `libCRATE_NAME.rmeta`.
- `mir` — Generates a file containing rustc’s mid-level intermediate representation. The default output filename is `CRATE_NAME.mir`.
- `obj` — Generates a native object file. The default output filename is `CRATE_NAME.o`.

The output filename can be set with the [`-o` flag](#option-o-output). A suffix may be added to the filename with the [`-C extra-filename` flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#extra-filename).

Output files are written to the current directory unless the [`--out-dir` flag](#option-out-dir) is used.

### [Custom paths for individual emit kinds](#custom-paths-for-individual-emit-kinds)

Each emit type can optionally be followed by `=` to specify an explicit output path that only applies to the output of that type. For example:

- `--emit=link,dep-info=/path/to/dep-info.d`
  
  - Emit the crate itself as normal, and also emit dependency info to the specified path.
- `--emit=llvm-ir=-,mir`
  
  - Emit MIR to the default filename (based on crate name), and emit LLVM IR to stdout.

### [Emitting to stdout](#emitting-to-stdout)

When using `--emit` or [`-o`](#option-o-output), output can be sent to stdout by specifying `-` as the path (e.g. `-o -`).

Binary output types can only be written to stdout if it is not a tty. Text output types (`asm`, `dep-info`, `llvm-ir` and `mir`) can be written to stdout regardless of whether it is a tty or not.

Only one type of output can be written to stdout. Attempting to write multiple types to stdout at the same time will result in an error.

## [`--print`: print compiler information](#--print-print-compiler-information)

This flag will allow you to set [print options](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments/print-options.html).

## [`-g`: include debug information](#-g-include-debug-information)

A synonym for [`-C debuginfo=2`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#debuginfo).

## [`-O`: optimize your code](#-o-optimize-your-code)

A synonym for [`-C opt-level=3`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#opt-level).

## [`-o`: filename of the output](#-o-filename-of-the-output)

This flag controls the output filename.

## [`--out-dir`: directory to write the output in](#--out-dir-directory-to-write-the-output-in)

The outputted crate will be written to this directory. This flag is ignored if the [`-o` flag](#option-o-output) is used.

## [`--explain`: provide a detailed explanation of an error message](#--explain-provide-a-detailed-explanation-of-an-error-message)

Each error of `rustc`’s comes with an error code; this will print out a longer explanation of a given error.

## [`--test`: build a test harness](#--test-build-a-test-harness)

When compiling this crate, `rustc` will ignore your `main` function and instead produce a test harness. See the [Tests chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/index.html) for more information about tests.

## [`--target`: select a target tuple to build](#--target-select-a-target-tuple-to-build)

This controls which [target](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/targets/index.html) to produce.

## [`-W`: set lint warnings](#-w-set-lint-warnings)

This flag will set which lints should be set to the [warn level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#warn).

*Note:* The order of these lint level arguments is taken into account, see [lint level via compiler flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#via-compiler-flag) for more information.

## [`--force-warn`: force a lint to warn](#--force-warn-force-a-lint-to-warn)

This flag sets the given lint to the [forced warn level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#force-warn) and the level cannot be overridden, even ignoring the [lint caps](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#capping-lints).

## [`-A`: set lint allowed](#-a-set-lint-allowed)

This flag will set which lints should be set to the [allow level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#allow).

*Note:* The order of these lint level arguments is taken into account, see [lint level via compiler flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#via-compiler-flag) for more information.

## [`-D`: set lint denied](#-d-set-lint-denied)

This flag will set which lints should be set to the [deny level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#deny).

*Note:* The order of these lint level arguments is taken into account, see [lint level via compiler flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#via-compiler-flag) for more information.

## [`-F`: set lint forbidden](#-f-set-lint-forbidden)

This flag will set which lints should be set to the [forbid level](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#forbid).

*Note:* The order of these lint level arguments is taken into account, see [lint level via compiler flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#via-compiler-flag) for more information.

## [`-Z`: set unstable options](#-z-set-unstable-options)

This flag will allow you to set unstable options of rustc. In order to set multiple options, the -Z flag can be used multiple times. For example: `rustc -Z verbose-internals -Z time-passes`. Specifying options with -Z is only available on nightly. To view all available options run: `rustc -Z help`, or see [The Unstable Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/index.html).

## [`--cap-lints`: set the most restrictive lint level](#--cap-lints-set-the-most-restrictive-lint-level)

This flag lets you ‘cap’ lints, for more, [see here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/levels.html#capping-lints).

## [`-C`/`--codegen`: code generation options](#-c--codegen-code-generation-options)

This flag will allow you to set [codegen options](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html).

## [`-V`/`--version`: print a version](#-v--version-print-a-version)

This flag will print out `rustc`’s version.

## [`-v`/`--verbose`: use verbose output](#-v--verbose-use-verbose-output)

This flag, when combined with other flags, makes them produce extra output.

## [`--extern`: specify where an external library is located](#--extern-specify-where-an-external-library-is-located)

This flag allows you to pass the name and location for an external crate of a direct dependency. Indirect dependencies (dependencies of dependencies) are located using the [`-L` flag](#option-l-search-path). The given crate name is added to the [extern prelude](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/names/preludes.html#extern-prelude), similar to specifying `extern crate` within the root module. The given crate name does not need to match the name the library was built with.

Specifying `--extern` has one behavior difference from `extern crate`: `--extern` merely makes the crate a *candidate* for being linked; it does not actually link it unless it’s actively used. In rare occasions you may wish to ensure a crate is linked even if you don’t actively use it from your code: for example, if it changes the global allocator or if it contains `#[no_mangle]` symbols for use by other programming languages. In such cases you’ll need to use `extern crate`.

This flag may be specified multiple times. This flag takes an argument with either of the following formats:

- `CRATENAME=PATH` — Indicates the given crate is found at the given path.
- `CRATENAME` — Indicates the given crate may be found in the search path, such as within the sysroot or via the `-L` flag.

The same crate name may be specified multiple times for different crate types. If both an `rlib` and `dylib` are found, an internal algorithm is used to decide which to use for linking. The [`-C prefer-dynamic` flag](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#prefer-dynamic) may be used to influence which is used.

If the same crate name is specified with and without a path, the one with the path is used and the pathless flag has no effect.

## [`--sysroot`: Override the system root](#--sysroot-override-the-system-root)

The “sysroot” is where `rustc` looks for the crates that come with the Rust distribution; this flag allows that to be overridden.

## [`--error-format`: control how errors are produced](#--error-format-control-how-errors-are-produced)

This flag lets you control the format of messages. Messages are printed to stderr. The valid options are:

- `human` — Human-readable output. This is the default.
- `json` — Structured JSON output. See [the JSON chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/json.html) for more detail.
- `short` — Short, one-line messages.

## [`--color`: configure coloring of output](#--color-configure-coloring-of-output)

This flag lets you control color settings of the output. The valid options are:

- `auto` — Use colors if output goes to a tty. This is the default.
- `always` — Always use colors.
- `never` — Never colorize output.

## [`--diagnostic-width`: specify the terminal width for diagnostics](#--diagnostic-width-specify-the-terminal-width-for-diagnostics)

This flag takes a number that specifies the width of the terminal in characters. Formatting of diagnostics will take the width into consideration to make them better fit on the screen.

## [`--remap-path-prefix`: remap source paths in output](#--remap-path-prefix-remap-source-paths-in-output)

Remap source path prefixes in all output, including compiler diagnostics, debug information, macro expansions, etc. It takes a value of the form `FROM=TO` where a path prefix equal to `FROM` is rewritten to the value `TO`. This flag may be specified multiple times.

Refer to the [Remap source paths](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/remap-source-paths.html) section of this book for further details and explanation.

## [`--remap-path-scope`: remap source paths in output](#--remap-path-scope-remap-source-paths-in-output)

Defines which scopes of paths should be remapped by `--remap-path-prefix`.

Refer to the [Remap source paths](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/remap-source-paths.html) section of this book for further details and explanation.

## [`--json`: configure json messages printed by the compiler](#--json-configure-json-messages-printed-by-the-compiler)

When the [`--error-format=json` option](#option-error-format) is passed to rustc then all of the compiler’s diagnostic output will be emitted in the form of JSON blobs. The `--json` argument can be used in conjunction with `--error-format=json` to configure what the JSON blobs contain as well as which ones are emitted.

With `--error-format=json` the compiler will always emit any compiler errors as a JSON blob, but the following options are also available to the `--json` flag to customize the output:

- `diagnostic-short` - json blobs for diagnostic messages should use the “short” rendering instead of the normal “human” default. This means that the output of `--error-format=short` will be embedded into the JSON diagnostics instead of the default `--error-format=human`.
- `diagnostic-rendered-ansi` - by default JSON blobs in their `rendered` field will contain a plain text rendering of the diagnostic. This option instead indicates that the diagnostic should have embedded ANSI color codes intended to be used to colorize the message in the manner rustc typically already does for terminal outputs. Note that this is usefully combined with crates like [`fwdansi`](https://crates.io/crates/fwdansi) to translate these ANSI codes on Windows to console commands or [`strip-ansi-escapes`](https://crates.io/crates/strip-ansi-escapes) if you’d like to optionally remove the ansi colors afterwards.
- `artifacts` - this instructs rustc to emit a JSON blob for each artifact that is emitted. An artifact corresponds to a request from the [`--emit` CLI argument](#option-emit), and as soon as the artifact is available on the filesystem a notification will be emitted.
- `future-incompat` - includes a JSON message that contains a report if the crate contains any code that may fail to compile in the future.
- `timings` - output a JSON message when a certain compilation “section” (such as frontend analysis, code generation, linking) begins or ends.

Note that it is invalid to combine the `--json` argument with the [`--color`](#option-color) argument, and it is required to combine `--json` with `--error-format=json`.

See [the JSON chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/json.html) for more detail.

## [`@path`: load command-line flags from a path](#path-load-command-line-flags-from-a-path)

If you specify `@path` on the command-line, then it will open `path` and read command line options from it. These options are one per line; a blank line indicates an empty option. The file can use Unix or Windows style line endings, and must be encoded as UTF-8.
