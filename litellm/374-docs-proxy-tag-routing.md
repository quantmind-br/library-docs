Route requests based on tags. This is useful for

- Implementing free / paid tiers for users
- Controlling model access per team, example Team A can access gpt-4 deployment A, Team B can access gpt-4 deployment B (LLM Access Control For Teams )

## Quick Start[​](#quick-start "Direct link to Quick Start")

### 1. Define tags on config.yaml[​](#1-define-tags-on-configyaml "Direct link to 1. Define tags on config.yaml")

- A request with `tags=["free"]` will get routed to `openai/fake`
- A request with `tags=["paid"]` will get routed to `openai/gpt-4o`

```
model_list:
-model_name: gpt-4
litellm_params:
model: openai/fake
api_key: fake-key
api_base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/
tags:["free"]# 👈 Key Change
-model_name: gpt-4
litellm_params:
model: openai/gpt-4o
api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
tags:["paid"]# 👈 Key Change
-model_name: gpt-4
litellm_params:
model: openai/gpt-4o
api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
api_base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/
tags:["default"]# OPTIONAL - All untagged requests will get routed to this


router_settings:
enable_tag_filtering:True# 👈 Key Change
general_settings:
master_key: sk-1234
```

### 2. Make Request with `tags=["free"]`[​](#2-make-request-with-tagsfree "Direct link to 2-make-request-with-tagsfree")

This request includes "tags": \["free"], which routes it to `openai/fake`

```
curl -i http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude gm!"}
    ],
    "tags": ["free"]
  }'
```

**Expected Response**

Expect to see the following response header when this works

```
x-litellm-model-api-base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/
```

Response

```

   {
     "finish_reason": "stop",

       "role": "assistant",
       "tool_calls": null,
       "function_call": null
     }
   }
 ],
 "created": 1677652288,

   "completion_tokens": 12,
   "prompt_tokens": 9,
   "total_tokens": 21
 }
}
```

### 3. Make Request with `tags=["paid"]`[​](#3-make-request-with-tagspaid "Direct link to 3-make-request-with-tagspaid")

This request includes "tags": \["paid"], which routes it to `openai/gpt-4`

```
curl -i http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude gm!"}
    ],
    "tags": ["paid"]
  }'
```

**Expected Response**

Expect to see the following response header when this works

```
x-litellm-model-api-base: https://api.openai.com
```

Response

```
{
 "id": "chatcmpl-9maCcqQYTqdJrtvfakIawMOIUbEZx",
 "choices": [
   {
     "finish_reason": "stop",
     "index": 0,
     "message": {
       "content": "Good morning! How can I assist you today?",
       "role": "assistant",
       "tool_calls": null,
       "function_call": null
     }
   }
 ],
 "created": 1721365934,
 "model": "gpt-4o-2024-05-13",
 "object": "chat.completion",
 "system_fingerprint": "fp_c4e5b6fa31",
 "usage": {
   "completion_tokens": 10,
   "prompt_tokens": 12,
   "total_tokens": 22
 }
}
```

You can also call via request header `x-litellm-tags`

```
curl -L -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/v1/chat/completions' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234' \
-H 'x-litellm-tags: free,my-custom-tag' \
-d '{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hey, how'\''s it going 123456?"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Use this if you want all untagged requests to be routed to specific deployments

1. Set default tag on your yaml

```
model_list:
-model_name: fake-openai-endpoint
litellm_params:
model: openai/fake
api_key: fake-key
api_base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/
tags:["default"]# 👈 Key Change - All untagged requests will get routed to this
model_info:
id:"default-model"# used for identifying model in response headers
```

2. Start proxy

```
$ litellm --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

3. Make request with no tags

```
curl -i http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" \
  -d '{
    "model": "fake-openai-endpoint",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude gm!"}
    ]
  }'
```

Expect to see the following response header when this works

```
x-litellm-model-id: default-model
```

## ✨ Team based tag routing (Enterprise)[​](#-team-based-tag-routing-enterprise "Direct link to ✨ Team based tag routing (Enterprise)")

LiteLLM Proxy supports team-based tag routing, allowing you to associate specific tags with teams and route requests accordingly. Example **Team A can access gpt-4 deployment A, Team B can access gpt-4 deployment B** (LLM Access Control For Teams)

Here's how to set up and use team-based tag routing using curl commands:

1. **Enable tag filtering in your proxy configuration:**
   
   In your `proxy_config.yaml`, ensure you have the following setting:
   
   ```
   model_list:
   -model_name: fake-openai-endpoint
   litellm_params:
   model: openai/fake
   api_key: fake-key
   api_base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/
   tags:["teamA"]# 👈 Key Change
   model_info:
   id:"team-a-model"# used for identifying model in response headers
   -model_name: fake-openai-endpoint
   litellm_params:
   model: openai/fake
   api_key: fake-key
   api_base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/
   tags:["teamB"]# 👈 Key Change
   model_info:
   id:"team-b-model"# used for identifying model in response headers
   -model_name: fake-openai-endpoint
   litellm_params:
   model: openai/fake
   api_key: fake-key
   api_base: https://exampleopenaiendpoint-production.up.railway.app/
   tags:["default"]# OPTIONAL - All untagged requests will get routed to this
   ```

router\_settings: enable\_tag\_filtering: True # 👈 Key Change

general\_settings: master\_key: sk-1234

````

2. **Create teams with tags:**

Use the `/team/new` endpoint to create teams with specific tags:

```shell
# Create Team A
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:4000/team/new \
 -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -d '{"tags": ["teamA"]}'
````

```
# Create Team B
curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:4000/team/new \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tags": ["teamB"]}'
```

These commands will return JSON responses containing the `team_id` for each team.

3. **Generate keys for team members:**
   
   Use the `/key/generate` endpoint to create keys associated with specific teams:
   
   ```
   # Generate key for Team A
   curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/generate \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"team_id": "team_a_id_here"}'
   ```
   
   ```
   # Generate key for Team B
   curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/generate \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-1234" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"team_id": "team_b_id_here"}'
   ```
   
   Replace `team_a_id_here` and `team_b_id_here` with the actual team IDs received from step 2.
4. **Verify routing:**
   
   Check the `x-litellm-model-id` header in the response to confirm that the request was routed to the correct model based on the team's tags. You can use the `-i` flag with curl to include the response headers:
   
   Request with Team A's key (including headers)
   
   ```
   curl -i -X POST http://0.0.0.0:4000/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer team_a_key_here" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "fake-openai-endpoint",
       "messages": [
         {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
       ]
     }'
   ```
   
   In the response headers, you should see:
   
   ```
   x-litellm-model-id: team-a-model
   ```
   
   Similarly, when using Team B's key, you should see:
   
   ```
   x-litellm-model-id: team-b-model
   ```

By following these steps and using these curl commands, you can implement and test team-based tag routing in your LiteLLM Proxy setup, ensuring that different teams are routed to the appropriate models or deployments based on their assigned tags.
