Python Workflows are in beta, as well as the underlying platform.

You must add both `python_workflows` and `python_workers` compatibility flags to your Wrangler config file.

Also, Python Workflows requires `compatibility_date = "2025-08-01"`, or later, to be set in your Wrangler config file.

The Python Workers platform leverages [FFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface) to access bindings to Cloudflare resources. Refer to the [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/python/ffi/#using-bindings-from-python-workers) documentation for more information.

From the configuration perspective, enabling Python Workflows requires adding the `python_workflows` compatibility flag to your `wrangler.toml` file.

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    "$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
    "name": "workflows-starter",
    "main": "src/index.ts",
    "compatibility_date": "2025-10-24",
    "compatibility_flags": [
      "python_workflows",
      "python_workers"
    ],
    "workflows": [
      {
        "name": "workflows-starter",
        "binding": "MY_WORKFLOW",
        "class_name": "MyWorkflow"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  #:schema node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json
  name = "workflows-starter"
  main = "src/index.ts"
  compatibility_date = "2025-10-24"
  compatibility_flags = ["python_workflows", "python_workers"]


  [[workflows]]
  # name of your workflow
  name = "workflows-starter"
  # binding name env.MY_WORKFLOW
  binding = "MY_WORKFLOW"
  # this is class that extends the Workflow class in src/index.ts
  class_name = "MyWorkflow"
  ```

And this is how you use the payload in your workflow:

```python
from pyodide.ffi import to_js


class DemoWorkflowClass(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):
        @step.do('step-name')
        async def first_step():
            payload = event["payload"]
            return payload
```

## Workflow

The `Workflow` binding gives you access to the [Workflow](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflow) class. All its methods are available on the binding.

Under the hood, the `Workflow` binding is a Javascript object that is exposed to the Python script via [JsProxy](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/python-api/ffi.html#pyodide.ffi.JsProxy). This means that the values returned by its methods are also `JsProxy` objects, and need to be converted back into Python objects using `python_from_rpc`.

### `create`

Create (trigger) a new instance of a given Workflow.

* `create(options=None)`\* `options` - an **optional** dictionary of options to pass to the workflow instance. Should contain the same keys as the [WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowinstancecreateoptions) type.

```python
from js import Object
from pyodide.ffi import to_js
from workers import WorkerEntrypoint, Response




class Default(WorkerEntrypoint):
    async def fetch(self, request):
        event = {"foo": "bar"}
        options = to_js({"params": event}, dict_converter=Object.fromEntries)
        await self.env.MY_WORKFLOW.create(options)
        return Response.json({"status": "success"})
```

Note

Values returned from steps need to be converted into Javascript objects using `to_js`. This is why we explicitly construct the payload using `Object.fromEntries`.

The `create` method returns a [`WorkflowInstance`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowinstance) object, which can be used to query the status of the workflow instance. Note that this is a Javascript object, and not a Python object.

### `create_batch`

Create (trigger) a batch of new workflow instances, up to 100 instances at a time. This is useful if you need to create multiple instances at once within the [instance creation limit](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/reference/limits/).

* `create_batch(batch)`\* `batch` - list of `WorkflowInstanceCreateOptions` to pass when creating an instance, including a user-provided ID and payload parameters.

Each element of the `batch` list is expected to include both `id` and `params` properties:

```python
from pyodide.ffi import to_js
from js import Object


# Create a new batch of 3 Workflow instances, each with its own ID and pass params to the Workflow instances
listOfInstances = [
  to_js({ "id": "id-abc123", "params": { "hello": "world-0" } }, dict_converter=Object.fromEntries),
  to_js({ "id": "id-def456", "params": { "hello": "world-1" } }, dict_converter=Object.fromEntries),
  to_js({ "id": "id-ghi789", "params": { "hello": "world-2" } }, dict_converter=Object.fromEntries)
];


await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create_batch(listOfInstances);
```

### `get`

Get a workflow instance by ID.

* `get(id)`\* `id` - the ID of the workflow instance to get.

Returns a [`WorkflowInstance`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowinstance) object, which can be used to query the status of the workflow instance.

```python
instance = await env.MY_WORKFLOW.get("abc-123")


# FFI methods available for WorkflowInstance
await instance.status()
await instance.pause()
await instance.resume()
await instance.restart()
await instance.terminate()
```

### `send_event`

Send an event to a workflow instance.

* `send_event(options)`\* `type` - the type of event to send to the workflow instance. \* `payload` - the payload to send to the workflow instance.

```python
from pyodide.ffi import to_js
from js import Object


await env.MY_WORKFLOW.send_event(to_js({ "type": "my-event-type", "payload": { "foo": "bar" } }, dict_converter=Object.fromEntries))
```

Note

Values passed to `send_event` require explicit type translation into JS objects.

## REST API (HTTP)

Refer to the [Workflows REST API documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/workflows/subresources/instances/methods/create/).

## Command line (CLI)

Refer to the [CLI quick start](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/get-started/guide/) to learn more about how to manage and trigger Workflows via the command-line.
