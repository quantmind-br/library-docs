## Credits[​](#credits "Direct link to heading")

This project was forked from [*spacebar*](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar) and completely reimagined and rewritten. The original idea is based on the status bar that was included in [*yabai*](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) before getting removed.
