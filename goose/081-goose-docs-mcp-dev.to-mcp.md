I'll help you fetch the recent JavaScript articles from Dev.to and create a nice HTML learning page. Let me start by getting the articles.

`─── per_page state tag ──────────────────────────`

Now I'll create a beautiful HTML learning page with all the requested features:

`─── writing /Users/ebonyl/... ──────────────────────────`

Perfect! I've created a beautiful HTML landing page featuring the 5 most recent JavaScript articles from Dev.to. Here's what I've included:

🎯 Key Features

- 📱 Responsive design with a modern gradient background and card-based layout
- 🔗 Clickable article titles that open in new tabs
- 👤 Author names and reading times for each article
- 📝 One-sentence summaries explaining what each article covers
- 🏷️ Tag display showing the relevant technologies
- ⭐ Priority recommendation with visual highlighting
- actionable projects to build to further learning 🎨 Design Elements
- Gradient backgrounds and smooth hover effects
- Clean typography using system fonts
- Color-coded recommendation system
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Professional card-based design with shadows and animations 📖 Content Highlights

Top Recommendation: The Signal Clone tutorial (Part One) by Oluwabusayo Jacobs is highlighted as the must-read article because:

It's a comprehensive 29-minute deep dive Covers real-world messaging app development Includes authentication and real-time features Uses React Native and Stream (highly transferable to web development) Provides practical, hands-on learning experience

The landing page is saved as `javascript_articles_landing.html` and ready to open in your browser! Each article link will take you directly to the full Dev.to article for deeper reading.
