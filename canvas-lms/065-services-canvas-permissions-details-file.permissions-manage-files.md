Allows user to add course files and folders.

Allows user to import a zip file.

Allows user to edit course files and folders.

Allows user to delete course files and folders.

### Additional Considerations

If one or all permissions are disabled, user can still view and download files into a zip file.

To import files using the Course Import Tool, Course files - add and Course Content - add / edit / delete must be enabled.

To edit lock settings for course files, Course files - edit, Blueprint Courses - add / edit / associate / delete, and Courses - manage must also be enabled.
