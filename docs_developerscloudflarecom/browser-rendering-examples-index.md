## REST API examples

Use these [REST API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/) examples to perform quick, common tasks.

[Fetch rendered HTML from a URL ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/content-endpoint/#fetch-rendered-html-from-a-url)Capture fully rendered HTML from a webpage after JavaScript execution.

[Take a screenshot of the visible viewport ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/screenshot-endpoint/#basic-usage)Capture a screenshot of a fully rendered webpage from a URL or custom HTML.

[Take a screenshot of the full page ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/screenshot-endpoint/#navigate-and-capture-a-full-page-screenshot)Capture a screenshot of an entire scrollable webpage, not just the visible viewport.

[Take a screenshot of an authenticated page ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/screenshot-endpoint/#capture-a-screenshot-of-an-authenticated-page)Capture a screenshot of a webpage that requires login by providing session cookies.

[Generate a PDF ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/pdf-endpoint/#basic-usage)Generate a PDF from a URL or custom HTML and CSS.

[Extract Markdown from a URL ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/markdown-endpoint/#convert-a-url-to-markdown)Convert a webpage's content into Markdown format.

[Capture a snapshot from a URL ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/snapshot/#capture-a-snapshot-from-a-url)Capture both the rendered HTML and a screenshot from a webpage in a single request.

[Scrape headings and links from a URL ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/scrape-endpoint/#extract-headings-and-links-from-a-url)Extract structured data from specific elements on a webpage using CSS selectors.

[Capture structured data with an AI prompt and JSON schema ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/json-endpoint/#with-a-prompt-and-json-schema)Extract structured data from a webpage using AI using a prompt or JSON schema.

[Retrieve links from a URL ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/rest-api/links-endpoint/#get-all-links-on-a-page)Retrieve all links from a webpage, including hidden ones.

## Workers Bindings examples

Use [Workers Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/) for dynamic, multi-step browser automation with [Puppeteer](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/), [Playwright](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/), or [Stagehand](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/stagehand/).

[Get page metrics with Puppeteer ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/puppeteer/#use-puppeteer-in-a-worker)Use Puppeteer to navigate to a page and retrieve performance metrics in a Worker.

[Take a screenshot with Playwright ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/#take-a-screenshot)Use Playwright to navigate to a page, interact with elements, and capture a screenshot.

[Run test assertions with Playwright ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/#assertions)Use Playwright assertions to test web applications in a Worker.

[Generate a trace with Playwright ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/playwright/#trace)Capture detailed execution logs for debugging with Playwright tracing.

[Reuse browser sessions ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/reuse-sessions/)Improve performance by reusing browser sessions across requests.

[Persist sessions with Durable Objects ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/workers-bindings/browser-rendering-with-do/)Use Durable Objects to maintain long-running browser sessions.

[AI-powered browser automation with Stagehand ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/stagehand/#use-stagehand-in-a-worker-with-workers-ai)Use natural language instructions to automate browser tasks with AI.
