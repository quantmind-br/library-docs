[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is an application monitoring platform that helps developers identify and fix issues in real-time. With Sentry's AI monitoring capabilities, you can track LLM performance and errors.

## Step 1: Get your Sentry OTLP endpoint and DSN

In Sentry, navigate to your project's SDK setup:

1. Log in to your Sentry account
2. Go to **Settings > Projects > \[Your Project] > SDK Setup > Client Keys (DSN)**
3. Click on the **OpenTelemetry** tab
4. Copy the **OTLP Traces Endpoint** URL (ends with `/v1/traces`)
5. Copy your **DSN** from the same page

## Step 2: Enable Broadcast in OpenRouter

Go to [Settings > Observability](https://openrouter.ai/settings/observability) and toggle **Enable Broadcast**.

![Enable Broadcast](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/7386b119bd35a485ec53b6f15e3dfe3a980fc5bf61a573256e27ae607ef5614a/content/pages/features/broadcast/broadcast-enable.png)

## Step 3: Configure Sentry

Click the edit icon next to **Sentry** and enter:

* **OTLP Traces Endpoint**: The OTLP endpoint URL from Sentry (e.g., `https://o123.ingest.us.sentry.io/api/456/integration/otlp/v1/traces`)
* **Sentry DSN**: Your Sentry DSN (e.g., `https://abc123@o123.ingest.us.sentry.io/456`)

## Step 4: Test and save

Click **Test Connection** to verify the setup. The configuration only saves if the test passes.

## Step 5: Send a test trace

Make an API request through OpenRouter and view the trace in Sentry's
Performance or Traces view.

<Tip>
  Sentry uses OpenTelemetry for trace ingestion. The OTLP endpoint and DSN
  are both required for proper authentication and trace routing.
</Tip>

## Custom Metadata

Sentry receives traces via the OTLP protocol. Custom metadata from the `trace` field is sent as span attributes and can be used for filtering and analysis in Sentry's Performance view.

### Supported Metadata Keys

| Key               | Sentry Mapping   | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `trace_id`        | Trace ID         | Group multiple requests into a single trace      |
| `trace_name`      | Transaction Name | Custom name for the root span                    |
| `span_name`       | Span Description | Name for intermediate spans in the hierarchy     |
| `generation_name` | Span Description | Name for the LLM generation span                 |
| `parent_span_id`  | Parent Span ID   | Link to an existing span in your trace hierarchy |

### Example

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "messages": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Debug this error..." }],
  "user": "user_12345",
  "session_id": "session_abc",
  "trace": {
    "trace_id": "incident_investigation_001",
    "trace_name": "Error Analysis Agent",
    "generation_name": "Analyze Stack Trace",
    "environment": "production",
    "release": "v2.1.0"
  }
}
```

### Additional Context

* Custom metadata keys from `trace` are included as span attributes under the `trace.metadata.*` namespace
* The `user` field maps to `user.id` in span attributes
* The `session_id` field maps to `session.id` in span attributes
* Sentry automatically correlates LLM traces with your application's existing error and performance data when using `parent_span_id`

## Privacy Mode

When [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) is enabled for this destination, prompt and completion content is excluded from traces. All other trace data — token usage, costs, timing, model information, and custom metadata — is still sent normally. See [Privacy Mode](/docs/guides/features/broadcast#privacy-mode) for details.
