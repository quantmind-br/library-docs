## Intro

Module 1 walks through launching an AI-assisted development workflow: setting up the Zencoder tooling, partnering with specialized agents, and shipping a team productivity tracker while keeping quality signals in place for scale.

## Video lesson

## Key takeaways

- Install the Zencoder extensions in VS Code and JetBrains, and tailor the workspace so the agent panel and files stay visible together.
- Kick off new projects by asking the agent discovery questions to surface best practices, feature ideas, and a recommended stack before coding.
- Let the Code Agent scaffold a React + Vite + TypeScript codebase, handling terminal commands, folder structure, and initial configuration.
- Use the Web Dev Agent to craft UI components, polish styling, and verify responsiveness via live browsing, screenshots, and viewport checks.
- Iterate feature-by-feature—team member sidebar, task cards, filters, modals, stats, search, and progress bars—letting agents reuse and extend existing files.
- Rely on the Unit Test Agent to introduce Vitest, seed meaningful coverage for task creation, filtering, and status updates, and keep tests green.
- Leverage the End-to-End Test Agent to script Playwright flows that exercise adding, filtering, completing, and searching tasks like a real user.
- Generate a repo.md with the Repo Info Agent so later coding sessions start with instant context instead of re-reading the entire codebase.
