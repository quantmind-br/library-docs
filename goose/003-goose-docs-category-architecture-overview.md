[**📄️ goose Architecture**  
\
goose, an open source AI Agent, builds upon the basic interaction framework of Large Language Models (LLMs), which primarily functions as a text-based conversational interface. It processes text input and generates text output. This "text in, text out" approach is enhanced with tool integrations, which allows the AI agent to complete tasks, creating goose.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/goose-architecture/)
