## Reference architectures

Explore the following reference architectures that use Queues:

[Fullstack applications](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[A practical example of how these services come together in a real fullstack application architecture.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/fullstack-application/)

[Serverless ETL pipelines](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-etl/)

[Cloudflare enables fully serverless ETL pipelines, significantly reducing complexity, accelerating time to production, and lowering overall costs.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/serverless/serverless-etl/)

[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)

[RAG combines retrieval with generative models for better text. It uses external knowledge to create factual, relevant responses, improving coherence and accuracy in NLP tasks like chatbots.](https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/diagrams/ai/ai-rag/)
