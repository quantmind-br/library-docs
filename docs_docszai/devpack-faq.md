# FAQs

## GLM Coding Plan Details

**Q: How much usage quota does the plan provide?**

**A:** Subscribe once, unlock unmatched usage and unbeatable value.

* **Lite Plan**: Up to \~120 prompts every 5 hours — about 3× the usage quota of the Claude Pro plan.
* **Pro Plan**: Up to \~600 prompts every 5 hours — about 3× the usage quota of the Claude Max (5x) plan.
* **Max Plan**: Up to \~2400 prompts every 5 hours — about 3× the usage quota of the Claude Max (20x) plan.

In terms of token consumption, each prompt typically allows 15–20 model calls, giving a total monthly allowance of tens of billions of tokens — all at only \~1% of standard API pricing, making it extremely cost-effective.

> The above figures are estimates. Actual usage may vary depending on project complexity, codebase size, and whether auto-accept features are enabled.

**Q: Which models are supported? How can I switch between them?**

**A:** This plan is powered by Z.ai’s latest flagship models **GLM-4.7**, **GLM-4.6**, **GLM-4.5** and **GLM-4.5-Air**. Switching works as follows.

<Check>
  Mapping between Claude Code internal model environment variables and GLM models, with the default configuration as follows:

  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`: `GLM-4.7`
  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`: `GLM-4.7`
  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`: `GLM-4.5-Air` If adjustments are needed, you can directly modify the configuration file (for example, \~/.claude/settings.json in Claude Code) to switch to GLM-4.5 or other models.

**Q: Which coding tools are supported?**

**A:** The pack currently supports [**Claude Code, Roo Code, Kilo Code, Cline, OpenCode, Crush, Goose**](/devpack/tool/goose)]\(/devpack/tool/crush)]\(/devpack/tool/opencode)]\(/devpack/tool/cline)]\(/devpack/tool/kilo)]\(/devpack/tool/roo)]\(/devpack/tool/claude), and more. Please refer to our tool guide for step-by-step setup. All supported coding tools share the same usage quota under your subscription.

***

**Q: Can I use my GLM Coding Plan quota in non-AI coding tools?**

**A:**  No. The GLM Coding Plan quota is **only** intended to be used within coding/IDE tools designated or recognized by [Z.ai](http://Z.ai) (such as Claude Code, Kilo Code, etc.) for personal code-assistance scenarios in your local IDE or terminal.

If you want to integrate GLM models into your own applications, websites, bots, SaaS products or other systems via API, please use [Z.ai](http://Z.ai)’s enterprise-grade API / MaaS services and follow the corresponding terms and pricing.

***

**Q: Can the plan only be used within supported coding tools?**

**A:** Yes. API calls are billed separately and do not use the Coding Plan quota.

***

**Q: What happens when my plan quota runs out? Will the system consume my account balance?**

**A:** No. GLM-4.7 calls made in supported coding tools will **only** use your Coding Plan quota.

* Once the quota is used up, you’ll need to wait until the next **5-hour cycle** for it to refresh. The system will not deduct from your account balance.
* Users subscribed to the Coding Plan can only make calls via the plan’s quota in supported tools. API calls outside the plan are not available.

## Subscription Management

**Q: Will my subscription renew automatically?**

**A:** Yes. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle, and the fee will be charged to your saved payment method.

***

**Q: How are subscription fees deducted?**

**A:** The system deducts fees in the following order:

1. Credits balance will be used first.
2. If insufficient, cash balance will be used;.
3. If still insufficient, the remaining amount will be charged from your linked payment method (e.g., bank card or PayPal).

<Tip>
  Please note that a small minimum applies when charging your credit card. If the remaining amount is less, we will round up the deduction to meet this minimum.
</Tip>

***

**Q: How can I cancel my subscription?**

**A:** You can cancel your subscription on the subscription management page. Please make sure to cancel at least 24 hours before your next billing date to avoid auto-renewal. After cancellation, your current plan remains valid until it expires.

***

**Q: Can I get a refund?**

**A:** Subscription payments are generally non-refundable. You can still use the service until the end of your billing cycle. For special cases, please contact customer support.

***

## Upgrade your Plan

**Q: How can I upgrade my coding plan?**

**A:** For **same-tier plan upgrades** (e.g., monthly plan to annual plan), the newly purchased plan will **not take effect immediately**. It will only become active after the expiration of your current plan, meaning the validity periods of the plans are cumulative.

Example: Upgrading from a **Lite Monthly Plan** to a **Lite Annual Plan** will grant you a total of 13 months of service validity.

For **cross-tier plan upgrades**, the new plan will take effect immediately. The remaining value of your original plan will be converted into account balance on a pro-rated basis, which can be used to offset the price difference of the upgrade.

Example: Upgrading from a **Lite Monthly Plan** `$6` to a **Pro Monthly Plan** `$30` on the same day of purchase will require an additional payment of **\$24**.

***

</Tip>

***

**Q: How is a successful invitation defined? What does my friend need to do?**

**A:** A successful invitation must meet all of the following:

1. The referred friend shall access the campaign page through the inviter's unique referral link or code.
2. Your friend is a new user (has never paid for a subscription).
3. They complete their first GLM Coding Plan subscription payment within 72 hours.
4. The order is not refunded within 24 hours.

***

**Q: When will I receive the credits after inviting a friend?**

**A:** Credits are usually issued within 24-48 hours after your friend’s payment is confirmed and the order passes review. Check \[Finance - Transaction History]. If not received after 72 hours, contact support.

***

**Q: What does "friend’s actual payment amount" mean? How are credits calculated if a coupon is used?**

**A:** "Actual payment amount" refers to the final cash amount your friend paid for their first order.

For example: If a plan costs 100 USD, and your friend gets a 50% first-order discount, an extra 10% off from your referral, and uses 5 USD in credits, the final actual payment is 40 USD. Your credits will be calculated based on 40 USD (e.g., 10% of 40 USD = 4 USD). Credit calculation does not include any coupons, discounts, point deductions, or refunded amounts.

***

**Q: Why didn’t I receive credits after referring a friend?**

**A:** Common reasons include:

1. Your friend didn’t register using your exclusive link/code.
2. Your friend completed payment after 72 hours.
3. Your friend was not a new subscribing user.
4. The order was refunded.
5. The system detected unusual activity (e.g., bulk registrations, fraud).

**If none of these apply, please contact customer support with your account and your friend's registration information.**
