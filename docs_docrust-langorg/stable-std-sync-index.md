Useful synchronization primitives.

### [§](#the-need-for-synchronization)The need for synchronization

Conceptually, a Rust program is a series of operations which will be executed on a computer. The timeline of events happening in the program is consistent with the order of the operations in the code.

Consider the following code, operating on some global static variables:

```rust
// FIXME(static_mut_refs): Do not allow `static_mut_refs` lint
#![allow(static_mut_refs)]

static mut A: u32 = 0;
static mut B: u32 = 0;
static mut C: u32 = 0;

fn main() {
    unsafe {
        A = 3;
        B = 4;
        A = A + B;
        C = B;
        println!("{A} {B} {C}");
        C = A;
    }
}
```

It appears as if some variables stored in memory are changed, an addition is performed, result is stored in `A` and the variable `C` is modified twice.

When only a single thread is involved, the results are as expected: the line `7 4 4` gets printed.

As for what happens behind the scenes, when optimizations are enabled the final generated machine code might look very different from the code:

- The first store to `C` might be moved before the store to `A` or `B`, *as if* we had written `C = 4; A = 3; B = 4`.
- Assignment of `A + B` to `A` might be removed, since the sum can be stored in a temporary location until it gets printed, with the global variable never getting updated.
- The final result could be determined just by looking at the code at compile time, so [constant folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding) might turn the whole block into a simple `println!("7 4 4")`.

The compiler is allowed to perform any combination of these optimizations, as long as the final optimized code, when executed, produces the same results as the one without optimizations.

Due to the [concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29) involved in modern computers, assumptions about the program’s execution order are often wrong. Access to global variables can lead to nondeterministic results, **even if** compiler optimizations are disabled, and it is **still possible** to introduce synchronization bugs.

Note that thanks to Rust’s safety guarantees, accessing global (static) variables requires `unsafe` code, assuming we don’t use any of the synchronization primitives in this module.

### [§](#out-of-order-execution)Out-of-order execution

Instructions can execute in a different order from the one we define, due to various reasons:

- The **compiler** reordering instructions: If the compiler can issue an instruction at an earlier point, it will try to do so. For example, it might hoist memory loads at the top of a code block, so that the CPU can start [prefetching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_prefetching) the values from memory.
  
  In single-threaded scenarios, this can cause issues when writing signal handlers or certain kinds of low-level code. Use [compiler fences](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/atomic/fn.compiler_fence.html "fn std::sync::atomic::compiler_fence") to prevent this reordering.
- A **single processor** executing instructions [out-of-order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution): Modern CPUs are capable of [superscalar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superscalar_processor) execution, i.e., multiple instructions might be executing at the same time, even though the machine code describes a sequential process.
  
  This kind of reordering is handled transparently by the CPU.
- A **multiprocessor** system executing multiple hardware threads at the same time: In multi-threaded scenarios, you can use two kinds of primitives to deal with synchronization:
  
  - [memory fences](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/atomic/fn.fence.html "fn std::sync::atomic::fence") to ensure memory accesses are made visible to other CPUs in the right order.
  - [atomic operations](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/atomic/index.html "mod std::sync::atomic") to ensure simultaneous access to the same memory location doesn’t lead to undefined behavior.

### [§](#higher-level-synchronization-objects)Higher-level synchronization objects

Most of the low-level synchronization primitives are quite error-prone and inconvenient to use, which is why the standard library also exposes some higher-level synchronization objects.

These abstractions can be built out of lower-level primitives. For efficiency, the sync objects in the standard library are usually implemented with help from the operating system’s kernel, which is able to reschedule the threads while they are blocked on acquiring a lock.

The following is an overview of the available synchronization objects:

- [`Arc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Arc.html "struct std::sync::Arc"): Atomically Reference-Counted pointer, which can be used in multithreaded environments to prolong the lifetime of some data until all the threads have finished using it.
- [`Barrier`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Barrier.html "struct std::sync::Barrier"): Ensures multiple threads will wait for each other to reach a point in the program, before continuing execution all together.
- [`Condvar`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Condvar.html "struct std::sync::Condvar"): Condition Variable, providing the ability to block a thread while waiting for an event to occur.
- [`mpsc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/mpsc/index.html "mod std::sync::mpsc"): Multi-producer, single-consumer queues, used for message-based communication. Can provide a lightweight inter-thread synchronisation mechanism, at the cost of some extra memory.
- [`mpmc`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/mpmc/index.html "mod std::sync::mpmc"): Multi-producer, multi-consumer queues, used for message-based communication. Can provide a lightweight inter-thread synchronisation mechanism, at the cost of some extra memory.
- [`Mutex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html "struct std::sync::Mutex"): Mutual Exclusion mechanism, which ensures that at most one thread at a time is able to access some data.
- [`Once`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.Once.html "struct std::sync::Once"): Used for a thread-safe, one-time global initialization routine. Mostly useful for implementing other types like [`OnceLock`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.OnceLock.html "struct std::sync::OnceLock").
- [`OnceLock`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.OnceLock.html "struct std::sync::OnceLock"): Used for thread-safe, one-time initialization of a variable, with potentially different initializers based on the caller.
- [`LazyLock`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.LazyLock.html "struct std::sync::LazyLock"): Used for thread-safe, one-time initialization of a variable, using one nullary initializer function provided at creation.
- [`RwLock`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html "struct std::sync::RwLock"): Provides a mutual exclusion mechanism which allows multiple readers at the same time, while allowing only one writer at a time. In some cases, this can be more efficient than a mutex.
