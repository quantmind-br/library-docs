Query or change data on clipboards specified by `t` based on the value of `d`.

`t` is a list of **zero or more** characters that each correspond to a different type of clipboard on the system. The meaning of each character in `t` as defined by xterm is as follows:

`t`Type`c`Standard clipboard`p`Primary clipboard`q`Secondary clipboard`s`Selection clipboard`0`–`7`Cut-buffer `0`–`7`

> Ghostty only recognizes `c`, `p`, and `s` as valid values in `t`. Other types are treated as aliases for `c`. When `t` is omitted, Ghostty defaults to querying or modifying the primary clipboard (equivalent to `c`).

> Ghostty currently only allows specifying one clipboard per sequence. This is a limitation on our end and may be fixed in the future.

When `d` is the single character `?`, the terminal will reply with another OSC 52 sequence with the data found from the first clipboard listed in `t` that contains the requested data.

Otherwise, `d` is expected to be a Base64-encoded string that contains the new data for all clipboards listed in `t`.

If `d` is neither a valid Base64-encoded string or the character `?`, all clipboards listed in `t` are cleared.
