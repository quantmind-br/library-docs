[**🗃️ Managing Sessions**  
\
3 items](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/sessions/)

[**🗃️ Context Engineering**  
\
3 items](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/context-engineering/)

[**🗃️ Recipes**  
\
4 items](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/recipes/)

[**📄️ Managing Projects**  
\
goose Projects automatically track your working directories and associated sessions, making it easy to resume work across multiple codebases with full context preservation.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/managing-projects)

[**🗃️ Managing Tools**  
\
3 items](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/managing-tools/)

[**📄️ goose Permissions**  
\
goose’s permissions determine how much autonomy it has when modifying files, using extensions, and performing automated actions. By selecting a permission mode, you have full control over how goose interacts with your development environment.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/goose-permissions)

[**📄️ Updating goose**  
\
The goose CLI and desktop apps are under active and continuous development. To get the newest features and fixes, you should periodically update your goose client using the following instructions.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/updating-goose)

[**📄️ Quick Tips**  
\
Best practices for working with goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/tips)

[**📄️ CLI Commands**  
\
goose provides a command-line interface (CLI) with several commands for managing sessions, configurations and extensions. This guide covers all available CLI commands and interactive session features.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/goose-cli-commands)

[**🗃️ Security**  
\
2 items](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/security/)

[**📄️ CLI Providers**  
\
Use Claude Code, Codex, Cursor Agent, or Gemini CLI subscriptions in goose](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/cli-providers)

[**📄️ Subagents**  
\
Subagents are independent instances that execute tasks while keeping your main conversation clean and focused. They bring process isolation and context preservation by offloading work to separate instances. Think of them as temporary assistants that handle specific jobs without cluttering your chat with tool execution details.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/subagents)

[**📄️ MCP Sampling**  
\
Transforms MCP servers into intelligent agents that can think, analyze, and make decisions using goose's AI](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/mcp-sampling)

[**🗃️ MCP Apps and MCP-UI**  
\
1 item](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/interactive-chat/)

[**📄️ MCP Elicitation**  
\
How extensions can request structured information from you during a task](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/mcp-elicitation)

[**📄️ LLM Rate Limits**  
\
Rate limiting is the process of restricting the number of requests a user or application can send to an LLM API within a specific timeframe. LLM providers enforce this with the purpose of managing resources and preventing abuse.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/handling-llm-rate-limits-with-goose)

[**📄️ Logging System**  
\
goose uses a unified storage system for conversations and interactions. All conversations and interactions (both CLI and Desktop) are stored locally in the following locations:](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/logs)

[**📄️ File Management**  
\
Efficiently find and reference files in goose Desktop and follow best practices for safe file operations](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/file-management)

[**📄️ Run Tasks**  
\
When working with the goose CLI, you can pass files and instructions to the goose run command to execute tasks and workflows. This could be a simple one-liner command or a complex set of instructions stored in a file.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/running-tasks)

[**📄️ Using gooseignore**  
\
.gooseignore is a text file that defines patterns for files and directories that goose will not access. This means goose cannot read, modify, delete, or run shell commands on these files when using the Developer extension's tools.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/using-gooseignore)

[**📄️ Configuration Files**  
\
goose uses YAML configuration files to manage settings and extensions. The primary config file is located at:](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/config-files)

[**📄️ Creating Plans**  
\
Starting a project without a clear plan is like building a house without a blueprint. It can lead to:](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/creating-plans)

[**📄️ Extension Allowlist**  
\
goose is an extensible framework that, by default, allows you to install any MCP server. However, you may want stricter controls on which MCP servers can be installed as extensions (e.g. in a corporate setting).](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/allowlist)

[**📄️ Environment Variables**  
\
goose supports various environment variables that allow you to customize its behavior. This guide provides a comprehensive list of available environment variables grouped by their functionality.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/environment-variables)

[**📄️ Multi-Model Config**  
\
Approaches for configuring model-switching behavior to optimize for cost, performance, and results.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/multi-model/)

[**📄️ goose in ACP Clients**  
\
Client applications that support the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) can connect natively to goose. This integration allows you to seamlessly interact with goose directly from the client.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/acp-clients)

[**📄️ Enhanced Code Editing**  
\
Use AI models to intelligently apply code changes](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/enhanced-code-editing)

[**📄️ Codebase Analysis**  
\
Understand codebases with semantic analysis and call graphs](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/codebase-analysis)

[**📄️ Terminal Integration**  
\
Talk to goose directly from your shell prompt. Instead of switching to a separate REPL session, stay in your terminal and call goose when you need it.](https://block.github.io/goose/docs/guides/terminal-integration)
