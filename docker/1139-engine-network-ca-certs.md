## Use CA certificates with Docker

> Best practices should be followed when using Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) CA certificates in production containers. If compromised, attackers could intercept sensitive data, spoof a trusted service, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. Consult your security team before you proceed.

If your company uses a proxy that inspects HTTPS traffic, you might need to add the required root certificates to your host machine and your Docker containers or images. This is because Docker and its containers, when pulling images or making network requests, need to trust the proxy’s certificates.

On the host, adding the root certificate ensures that any Docker commands (like `docker pull`) work without issues. For containers, you'll need to add the root certificate to the container's trust store either during the build process or at runtime. This ensures that applications running inside the containers can communicate through the proxy without encountering security warnings or connection failures.

The following sections describe how to install CA certificates on your macOS or Windows host. For Linux, refer to the documentation for your distribution.

### [macOS](#macos)

1. Download the CA certificate for your MITM proxy software.
2. Open the **Keychain Access** app.
3. In Keychain Access, select **System**, then switch to the **Certificates** tab.
4. Drag-and-drop the downloaded certificate into the list of certificates. Enter your password if prompted.
5. Find the newly added certificate, double-click it, and expand the **Trust** section.
6. Set **Always Trust** for the certificate. Enter your password if prompted.
7. Start Docker Desktop and verify that `docker pull` works, assuming Docker Desktop is configured to use the MITM proxy.

### [Windows](#windows)

Choose whether you want to install the certificate using the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or your web browser.

1. Download CA certificate for the MITM proxy software.
2. Open the Microsoft Management Console (`mmc.exe`).
3. Add the **Certificates Snap-In** in the MMC.
   
   1. Select **File** → **Add/Remove Snap-in**, and then select **Certificates** → **Add &gt;**.
   2. Select **Computer Account** and then **Next**.
   3. Select **Local computer** and then select **Finish**.
4. Import the CA certificate:
   
   1. From the MMC, expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**.
   2. Expand the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** section.
   3. Right-click **Certificates** and select **All Tasks** and **Import…**.
   4. Follow the prompts to import your CA certificate.
5. Select **Finish** and then **Close**.
6. Start Docker Desktop and verify that `docker pull` succeeds (assuming Docker Desktop is already configured to use the MITM proxy server).

> Depending on the SDK and/or runtime/framework in use, further steps may be required beyond adding the CA certificate to the operating system's trust store.

1. Download the CA certificate for your MITM proxy software.
2. Open your web browser, go to **Settings** and open **Manage certificates**
3. Select the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** tab.
4. Select **Import**, then browse for the downloaded CA certificate.
5. Select **Open**, then choose **Place all certificates in the following store**.
6. Ensure **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** is selected and select **Next**.
7. Select **Finish** and then **Close**.
8. Start Docker Desktop and verify that `docker pull` succeeds (assuming Docker Desktop is already configured to use the MITM proxy server).

If you need to run containerized workloads that rely on internal or custom certificates, such as in environments with corporate proxies or secure services, you must ensure that the containers trust these certificates. Without adding the necessary CA certificates, applications inside your containers may encounter failed requests or security warnings when attempting to connect to HTTPS endpoints.

By [adding CA certificates to images](#add-certificates-to-images) at build time, you ensure that any containers started from the image will trust the specified certificates. This is particularly important for applications that require seamless access to internal APIs, databases, or other services during production.

In cases where rebuilding the image isn't feasible, you can instead [add certificates to containers](#add-certificates-to-containers) directly. However, certificates added at runtime won’t persist if the container is destroyed or recreated, so this method is typically used for temporary fixes or testing scenarios.

> The following commands are for an Ubuntu base image. If your build uses a different Linux distribution, use equivalent commands for package management (`apt-get`, `update-ca-certificates`, and so on).

To add ca certificate to a container image when you're building it, add the following instructions to your Dockerfile.

### [Add certificates to containers](#add-certificates-to-containers)

> The following commands are for an Ubuntu-based container. If your container uses a different Linux distribution, use equivalent commands for package management (`apt-get`, `update-ca-certificates`, and so on).

To add a CA certificate to a running Linux container:

1. Download the CA certificate for your MITM proxy software.
2. If the certificate is in a format other than `.crt`, convert it to `.crt` format:
3. Copy the certificate into the running container:
4. Attach to the container:
5. Ensure the `ca-certificates` package is installed (required for updating certificates):
6. Copy the certificate to the correct location for CA certificates:
7. Update the CA certificates:
8. Verify that the container can communicate via the MITM proxy:
