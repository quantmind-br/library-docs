## What is Grocy?

Grocy is a web-based self-hosted groceries & household management solution for your home.
After installation your default credentials will be username: `admin`, password: `admin`.
Make sure to update these ASAP by logging in and editing the `admin` user in the settings, which can be found in the top right of your screen.
