## Integrate Docker Scout with Sysdig

The Sysdig integration enables Docker Scout to automatically detect the images you're using for your running workloads. Activating this integration gives you real-time insights about your security posture, and lets you compare your builds with what's running in production.

## [How it works](#how-it-works)

The Sysdig Agent captures the images of your container workloads. Docker Scout integrates with the Sysdig API to discover the images in your cluster. This integration uses Sysdig's Risk Spotlight feature. For more information, see [Risk Spotlight Integrations (Sysdig docs)](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/integrations-for-sysdig-secure/risk-spotlight-integrations/).

Each Sysdig integration maps to an environment. When you enable a Sysdig integration, you specify the environment name for that cluster, such as `production` or `staging`. Docker Scout assigns the images in the cluster to the corresponding environment. This lets you use the environment filters to see vulnerability status and policy compliance for an environment.

Only images analyzed by Docker Scout can be assigned to an environment. The Sysdig runtime integration doesn't trigger image analysis by itself. To analyze images automatically, enable a [registry integration](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/#container-registries).

Image analysis must not necessarily precede the runtime integration, but the environment assignment only takes place once Docker Scout has analyzed the image.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- Install the Sysdig Agent in the cluster that you want to integrate, see [Install Sysdig Agent (Sysdig docs)](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-monitor/install-sysdig-agent/).
- Enable profiling for Risk Spotlight Integrations in Sysdig, see [Profiling (Sysdig docs)](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/policies/profiling/#enablement).
- You must be an organization owner to enable the integration in the Docker Scout Dashboard.

## [Integrate an environment](#integrate-an-environment)

1. Go to the [Sysdig integration page](https://scout.docker.com/settings/integrations/sysdig/) on the Docker Scout Dashboard.
2. In the **How to integrate** section, enter a configuration name for this integration. Docker Scout uses this label as a display name for the integration.
3. Select **Next**.
4. Enter a Risk Spotlight API token and select the region in the drop-down list.
   
   The Risk Spotlight API token is the Sysdig token that Docker Scout needs to integrate with Sysdig. For more instructions on how to generate a Risk Spotlight token, See [Risk Spotlight Integrations (Sysdig docs)](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/integrations-for-sysdig-secure/risk-spotlight-integrations/docker-scout/#generate-a-token-for-the-integration).
   
   The region corresponds to the `global.sysdig.region` configuration parameter set when deploying the Sysdig Agent.
5. Select **Next**.
   
   After selecting **Next**, Docker Scout connects to Sysdig and retrieves the cluster names for your Sysdig account. Cluster names correspond to the `global.clusterConfig.name` configuration parameter set when deploying Sysdig Agents.
   
   An error displays if Docker Scout fails to connect to Sysdig using the provided token. If there's an error, you won't be able to continue the integration. Go back and verify that the configuration details are correct.
6. Select a cluster name in the drop-down list.
7. Select **Next**.
8. Assign an environment name for this cluster.
   
   You can reuse an existing environment or create a new one.
9. Select **Enable integration**.

After enabling the integration, Docker Scout automatically detects images running in the cluster, and assigns those images to the environment associated with the cluster. For more information about environments, see [Environment monitoring](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/environment/).

> Note
> 
> Docker Scout only detects images that have been analyzed. To trigger an image analysis, enable a [registry integration](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/#container-registries) and push an image to your registry.
> 
> If you created a new environment for this integration, the environment appears in Docker Scout when at least one image has been analyzed.

To integrate more clusters, go to the [Sysdig integrations page](https://scout.docker.com/settings/integrations/sysdig/) and select the **Add** button.
