   - David Mudrák was recently debugging database performance issues at the moodle.org community site, which took him down the rabbit hole to a wonderful world of [ad-hoc tasks](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/subsystems/task) in Moodle. David would like to share what he learned about the internals of ad-hoc tasks processing.
   - Audience: system administrators, developers. [Link to the presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mtDF101ZsJOnWXz6P-iqXlH0p7bkR24-5JWWpm-iTUo/edit?usp=sharing).
