- [CVE-2026-26982](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/security/advisories/GHSA-4jxv-xgrp-5m3r). Fixed an issue where control characters such as `0x03` (Ctrl+C) in pasted or drag-and-dropped text could be used to execute arbitrary commands in some shell environments. This requires user interaction (copy-paste or drag-and-drop) to trigger.

You can now search your terminal scrollback with `cmd+f` on macOS or `ctrl+shift+f` on GTK. Search highlights all matches in the viewport and allows you to navigate between them with the arrow buttons or `cmd+g` / `shift+cmd+g` (macOS) or `enter` / `shift+enter` (GTK). All of these keybinds are configurable, of course.

On macOS, the search bar can be dragged to any of the four corners of the terminal if it gets in the way. The search also integrates with standard macOS conventions: the menu bar, `Find Next` / `Find Previous` shortcuts, and the system find pasteboard all work as expected.

[![](https://ghostty.org/images/1-3-0/gtk-search.png)](https://ghostty.org/images/1-3-0/gtk-search.png)

On GTK, the search bar also appears in one of the corners and can be dragged to any corner.

Search is implemented using a dedicated search thread that operates concurrently with terminal I/O. The thread grabs the terminal lock in small time slices to make forward progress on searching while minimizing impact on I/O throughput or rendering. If you do not use search, or you close the search bar, the search thread exits and does not consume any resources.

Ghostty now has native scrollbars. A new `scrollbar` configuration controls whether scrollbars are visible, defaulting to `system` which lets the OS decide.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

The scrollbar on both macOS and GTK uses native widgets and styling, and supports all the standard interactions you would expect, such as dragging the knob, clicking the track, using scroll gestures, etc.

On both platforms, we use a minimal overlay-style scrollbar so that the terminal grid doesn't have to reserve space for the scrollbar with an aesthetically unpleasant gap or gutter. The scrollbar is overlaid on top of the terminal contents with minimal styling to prevent impacting selection.

PR: [#10455](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10455)

Ghostty now supports the [`click-events`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/#notes-for-shell-developers) and [`cl=line`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Per_Bothner/specifications/blob/master/proposals/semantic-prompts.md) extensions to the [OSC 133 Semantic Prompts specification](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/Per_Bothner/specifications/blob/master/proposals/semantic-prompts.md). This lets you click your mouse within an active shell prompt to move the cursor, like a normal text field.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

This feature is supported natively by Fish (v4+) and Nushell (0.111+). For other shells, support varies based on Ghostty's injected shell integration. If you're using a supported shell, this will just magically work.

Additionally, Ghostty now has a much more complete and accurate implementation of OSC 133 which enables more accurate behaviors for our long-supported jump-to-prompt or copy command output features. This also results in better resize behaviors while at an active prompt.

As a fun detail, we also added a really cool debug overlay that shows the OSC 133 areas, which were a significant help for shell developers working to better support this. This can be enabled by anyone in the terminal inspector.

Ghostty can now notify you when a long-running command finishes. This is useful when you kick off a build or test suite and switch to another window and want to be notified when it's done, for example.

Three new configuration options control this feature:

```
notify-on-command-finish = unfocused
notify-on-command-finish-action = no-bell,notify
notify-on-command-finish-after = 30s
```

`notify-on-command-finish` controls when notifications are sent: `never` (default), `unfocused` (only when the terminal is not focused), or `always`. `notify-on-command-finish-action` controls how you're notified, supporting `bell` (default) and `notify` (desktop notification), which can be combined or negated (e.g. `no-bell,notify`). `notify-on-command-finish-after` sets the minimum command duration before a notification is sent, defaulting to 5 seconds.

This feature uses OSC 133 escape sequences to track command execution, so it requires shell integration to be enabled or a shell that sends OSC 133 sequences natively such as Fish or Nushell.

PRs: [#9984](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9984) [#9961](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9961) [#9977](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9977) [#10098](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10098)

Ghostty 1.3 adds many new features to our keybind system for keybind power users: key tables, chained keybinds, and the `catch_all` special key.

**Key tables** enable tmux-like modal keybinding workflows. A key table is a named set of keybindings that can be activated or deactivated on demand. When a table is active, key presses are looked up within that table first, allowing you to create entirely separate keybinding modes.

Tables are defined using a `<name>/<binding>` syntax on the existing `keybind` configuration. For example:

```
keybind = resize/arrow_up=resize_split:up,10
keybind = resize/arrow_down=resize_split:down,10
keybind = resize/arrow_left=resize_split:left,10
keybind = resize/arrow_right=resize_split:right,10
keybind = resize/escape=deactivate_key_table
keybind = resize/catch_all=ignore

keybind = ctrl+a=activate_key_table:resize
```

In this example, pressing `ctrl+a` activates the `resize` table. While active, the arrow keys resize splits and all other keys are ignored. Pressing `escape` deactivates the table and returns to normal keybinding behavior.

On both macOS and GTK, a dedicated UI indicator shows when a key table is active, similar to the existing key sequence indicator.

[![](https://ghostty.org/images/1-3-0/key-overlay.png)](https://ghostty.org/images/1-3-0/key-overlay.png)

**Chained keybinds** let you bind multiple actions to a single key. Using the `chain` key, actions are appended to the most recently defined binding:

```
keybind = ctrl+shift+f=toggle_fullscreen
keybind = chain=toggle_window_decorations
```

This triggers both actions when `ctrl+shift+f` is pressed. Chains work within key tables and with key sequences.

**`catch_all`** is a new special key that matches any key not explicitly bound. It can be combined with modifiers (`ctrl+catch_all=ignore`) and used within key sequences (`ctrl+a>catch_all=end_key_sequence`), making it easy to build self-contained modal keybinding sets that don't leak unintended input to the terminal.

PR: [#9158](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9158)

New configurations `tab-inherit-working-directory` and `split-inherit-working-directory` allow you to control working directory inheritance independently for new tabs, windows, and split panes. This was one of the most requested configuration features.

```
window-inherit-working-directory = false
tab-inherit-working-directory = true
split-inherit-working-directory = true
```

Longer term, we plan on supporting better conditional configuration in a more general way, but this specific use case was so highly requested that we added these specific options for now to get it in sooner.

Clipboard copy now sets multiple content types on the clipboard (both `text/plain` and `text/html`) to enable rich text pasting with formatting so when you paste into a rich text editor, you get formatted text with colors and other styles preserved.

The `copy_to_clipboard` binding now supports a parameter specifying the format to copy. In addition to mixed, plain, and HTML formats, the binding also supports `vt` which copies text with terminal escape sequences to preserve formatting when pasting into another terminal.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

Text in Brahmic scripts such as Devanagari, Bengali, Tibetan, Javanese, Tai Tham, and Chakma now renders correctly. These scripts rely on font shaping to form ligatures, position combining marks, and join characters, and all of these are significantly improved.

An update to Unicode 17 with full conformance to the grapheme clustering specification means multi-codepoint characters are correctly treated as single units for selection, cursor movement, and cell width calculation.

[![](https://ghostty.org/images/1-3-0/shaping.png)](https://ghostty.org/images/1-3-0/shaping.png)

The first row shows the previous version and the second row shows 1.3.0 rendering the same text. Notice the improved ligature formation, combining mark placement, and grapheme clustering — in the first column, the selection highlight now correctly covers the entire character as a single unit.

Thanks to [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/), we received ~4GB of public terminal recording data to analyze and optimize Ghostty's performance. This is exciting because it's based on real-world terminal usage, not just synthetic workloads.

Using this data, we improved I/O processing considerably, lowering the time it took Ghostty to replay everything in the dataset from minutes to tens of seconds (with asciinema configured to ignore all pauses, of course). These improvements were also visible in synthetic benchmarks such as Alacritty's vtebench.

In addition to I/O updates, the renderer was rearchitected, lowering the time the renderer holds the terminal lock by **2x to 5x**. And in most frames, the renderer doesn't hold the lock at all thanks to improved dirty/damage tracking. This applies to both Metal and OpenGL.

Ghostty 1.3 includes a significant investment in stability and robustness.

This release fixes a major memory leak that Claude Code regularly triggered in prior Ghostty releases. This leak has existed since Ghostty 1.0 but was difficult or rare to trigger until Claude Code began exhibiting the perfect conditions to trigger this at scale, especially with their large user base. Details of the leak and the fix can be found [in this specific blog post about it](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-memory-leak-fix).

We also ran this release through extensive [AFL++](https://aflplus.plus/) fuzz testing for Ghostty's terminal escape sequence parser ([#11089](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/11089) ) and the full VT stream processor ([#11109](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/11109) ). We identified and fixed around 10 crashes and potential memory safety issues through this process. None of these were known to cause any real-world issues, but they may have! As a longer-term goal, we'd like to spin up infrastructure to continuously fuzz Ghostty.

We built a new testing tool called [Tripwire](https://mitchellh.com/writing/tripwire) ([#10401](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10401) ) to systematically test `errdefer` cleanup paths by injecting failures at every `try` site. This uncovered and fixed several bugs including memory leaks, state corruption, and glyph cache corruption in the font subsystem. This only addresses bugs in error recovery paths, so this helps Ghostty be more robust in the face of unexpected errors such as OOMs, GPU driver issues, etc.

On the memory side, we've optimized memory in a handful of places. Alt screen memory is now allocated on demand, saving several megabytes per terminal for sessions that never use it ([#9594](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9594) ). There are a variety of minor improvements in all subsystems, however.

Ghostty now has built-in AppleScript support on macOS, enabling powerful automation and integration capabilities. Using AppleScript, you can inspect and control windows, tabs, splits, and individual terminals. In addition to simple creation and navigation actions, you can also send text, key, and mouse input.

Some example workflows that are possible through scripting include automated terminal layouts, command broadcasting, jumping to terminals by working directory, and more.

Here is a short example that targets the currently focused terminal in the frontmost Ghostty window:

```applescript
tell application "Ghostty"
    set term to focused terminal of selected tab of front window
    input text "pwd\n" to term
end tell
```

AppleScript is enabled by default and secured by macOS Automation permissions (TCC), so macOS will prompt before another app can control Ghostty. If you don't want AppleScript support at all, set `macos-applescript = false`.

> We're treating this as a **preview feature in 1.3**. The AppleScript functionality didn't get as much time as other features to test in our pre-release builds, so we expect we'll make breaking API changes and add significant new features in 1.4 based on user feedback.

PR: [#10090](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10090)

You can now reorder splits on macOS by dragging them. When you hover near the top of a split, a grab handle appears that can be used to drag the split into any other split position. Simply grab the handle and drop the split where you want it; the terminal contents, working directory, and running processes all move with it.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

You can also drag splits out of windows or into new tabs, and all of this integrates with the undo/redo system so you can easily revert if you accidentally drop a split somewhere you didn't want it.

This is a mouse-driven approach to rearranging your terminal layout without having to close and recreate splits. The implementation also lays the groundwork for future enhancements like dragging splits into new tabs or windows.

A GTK implementation of this feature is planned for a future release.

PR: [#9116](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9116)

Update notifications on macOS are now unobtrusive. If a terminal window is open, update notifications appear as a small pill in the titlebar or bottom corner of the window instead of a disruptive popup window. The pill itself can be dismissed with a right click if you want to further hide it.

You can also trigger a full update and restart directly from the command palette with "Update and Restart" ([#9131](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9131) ), making the entire update process keyboard-driven.

There are no changes to the system requirements from Ghostty 1.2.

**macOS:** The minimum required macOS version for Ghostty 1.3 remains unchanged (macOS 13 Ventura).

**GTK:** Ghostty 1.3 requires **GTK 4.14** and **libadwaita 1.5**. This aligns with our [GTK/Adwaita version policy](https://ghostty.org/docs/linux/#supported-gtkadwaita-versions). Systems with older GTK or Adwaita versions can work around this requirement by using an older version of Ghostty or a community-maintained snap or flatpak package.

> **This is the last version to support macOS 13.** Starting with Ghostty 1.4 (and tip releases prior to 1.4), the minimum required macOS version will be macOS 14. Apple dropped security support for macOS 13 in the fall of 2025, so this change is in line with Apple's general support.

The following default behaviors have been changed in 1.3.0:

- The default clipboard copy format has changed from `text` to `mixed`. The `mixed` format sets both plain text and HTML on the clipboard. If this causes issues, you must rebind `copy_to_clipboard` with a specific format. [#9418](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9418)
- GTK: FreeType now defaults to light hinting instead of full hinting, matching the behavior of most other GTK applications. The old behavior can be restored via the `freetype-load-flags` configuration. [#9253](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9253)

<!--THE END-->

- Scrollback search is now available to search through terminal scrollback. This is triggered with `cmd+f` on macOS and `ctrl+shift+f` on GTK and comes with a number of new bindable actions. [#189](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/189)

- Ghostty can now show notifications when a command finishes using the `notify-on-command-finish` configuration. This can be set to trigger under various conditions such as slow commands, unfocused windows, etc. [#8991](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8991)
- A surface can now be marked "readonly" and it will no longer send any input events to the pty and will always warn before closing. This can be triggered by a new keyboard binding, command palette, etc. [#8432](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8432)
- A new configuration `key-remap` can be used to remap keys from one to another within the scope of Ghostty. Example: `key-remap = ctrl=super`. [#5160](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/5160)
- A new configuration `clipboard-codepoint-map` takes a mapping to replace some codepoints when copying to the clipboard (writing the clipboard, specifically). This would allow copying things like symbols for computing, branch drawing, etc. [#8383](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8383)

- A new configuration option `split-preserve-zoom` that starts with a single option `navigation` (default false). When navigation is set, zoomed splits will remain zoomed when split navigation (goto\_split) is done. [#8458](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8458) [#9089](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9089)
- A new binding action `goto_window:next` and `goto_window:previous` to deterministically navigate through windows. [#8387](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8387)
- A new binding action `toggle_mouse_reporting` toggles mouse reporting to the TUI. [#9282](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9282)
- A new `end_key_sequence` binding action to explicitly end an active key sequence, flushing prior keys to the terminal without encoding the triggering key (e.g. `ctrl+w>escape=end_key_sequence`). [#10098](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10098)
- The `close_tab` binding action takes a new parameter `right` which closes all tabs to the right. [#9783](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9783)
- `resize_split` and `toggle_split_zoom` actions now return false when there is only a single pane, allowing `performable:` keybinds to pass the key through to the terminal application. [#10376](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10376)
- The quick terminal now sets the `GHOSTTY_QUICK_TERMINAL` environment variable which can be used in any way, such as for custom shell prompts. [#9673](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9673)

- Right clicking a URL will now highlight the full URL. [#9298](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9298)
- Upgrade to Unicode 17. [#8757](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8757)
- The `+list-themes` command now has a keybind to write a configuration file. [#8930](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8930)
- Commands started with `-e` now set the terminal title to `argv[0]`. [#9121](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9121)
- Custom shaders have many new uniforms such as cursor shape, position, previous position, time since change, color scheme, etc. to support more advanced shaders. [#9416](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9416) [#9417](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9417)
- OSC7 URI parsing now handles more edge cases such as MAC addresses better. [#9193](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9193)
- Unsafe control characters in pasted text are now replaced with spaces to prevent malicious pastes from tricking users into executing unexpected commands, matching xterm's behavior. [#10746](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10746)
- IME preedit text is now rendered with underlines instead of inverted colors for better readability and consistency across programs. [#10368](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10368)
- Improved font rendering on some low-DPI monitors. [#9432](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9432)
- For font metrics, round cell height from line height instead of ceiling. This change should give more consistent results between high and low DPI displays. [#9648](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9648)
- Decouple balanced top and left window paddings to avoid diagonal resize window jitter. [#9518](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9518)
- Update many default keybindings to work with other keyboard layouts. This should not affect standard US layouts. [#9469](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9469)
- Ignore Unicode byte-order-mark (BOM) characters in the configuration file. [#9490](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/9490)

Localization is maintained by volunteer contributors. If you want to help localize Ghostty in your language, please open a discussion on the GitHub repo. Thank you to all the volunteers who contributed to Ghostty's localization!

- Ghostty now requires Zig 0.15 to build. [#8372](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/8372)

While not directly related to the Ghostty 1.3 release, one of the goals of the 1.3 development cycle was to begin focusing on [libghostty](https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming) in earnest, so I wanted to include an update on that here.

During the 1.3 development cycle, libghostty was successfully extracted and is now available as a standalone Zig module. The Zig module is full featured and shares almost all of its code with Ghostty. Simultaneously, there is a [work-in-progress C API](https://libghostty.tip.ghostty.org/index.html). There are a [set of Zig and C examples](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/tree/main/example) in the Ghostty repository.

We aren't ready to tag a versioned release for either of these modules yet, but dozens of projects both free and commercial are [already using libghostty](https://github.com/Uzaaft/awesome-libghostty), and I'm excited about it! If you're interested, there is a libghostty channel in our Discord.

The Ghostty development team has decided to separate the Ghostty GUI and libghostty release cycles, so libghostty will have its own versioning and release schedule independent of the Ghostty desktop application. This allows us to maintain different paces of development for the library and the desktop application, which have different user bases and stability requirements.

We aren't sure yet when we'll tag the first libghostty releases, but work continues on both the Zig module and C API, and we hope to have a release soon!

Ghostty officially became a [non-profit project](https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor) during the 1.3 development cycle.

This matters because it provides enforceable assurances that Ghostty cannot be sold, pivoted, or repurposed for commercial gain. The non-profit structure protects the people and communities that adopt and contribute to Ghostty, ensuring the project is stewarded by a mission-driven entity that prioritizes public benefit over private profit. For more on the motivation behind this decision, see the [original announcement](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-non-profit).

We have now officially signed **5 contributor contracts**, compensating individuals who are involved in the project and have consistently demonstrated high-quality work. These contracts cover community management, graphics work, Unicode compatibility, GTK, and Discord/GitHub integrations. These contracts commit almost 300 hours of billable work, and we're excited to provide paid opportunities for contributors to continue their work on Ghostty.

If you'd like to support Ghostty, please visit our [sponsorship page](https://ghostty.org/docs/sponsor).

With highly requested features like scrollback search and native scrollbars now implemented, I believe Ghostty 1.3 is a great release that delivers on the longstanding goal to make Ghostty the ["best existing terminal emulator"](https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-1-0-reflection).

"Best" will always be subjective, of course, but the point is that Ghostty 1.3 has all the mainstream features that users expect from any established terminal emulator, and it delivers them with a high level of polish and performance. We'll continue to improve Ghostty, of course, but this marks a major milestone in the project's development.

The short-term focus will be on stabilizing and tagging a [libghostty](https://mitchellh.com/writing/libghostty-is-coming) release. Dozens of projects are [already using libghostty](https://github.com/Uzaaft/awesome-libghostty), and I believe that ultimately libghostty will be more widely used and influential than the Ghostty desktop application itself, so this is an important next step for the project.

There is also a lot of non-profit development work to be done such as building out a corporate sponsorship program, providing more tangible benefits for sponsoring the project, better advertising what Ghostty is doing with funds, and more.

Ghostty 1.4 will continue to iterate and improve the desktop application. I don't want to promise any specific features, but we're working hard on making Ghostty scriptable, enabling a true Tmux control mode, graphical preferences, and more.

To answer a common request, support for **Microsoft Windows** is still not planned. This still remains part of the long term roadmap, but I think that focusing on a capable and powerful libghostty will enable better Windows support in the long run. libghostty itself already supports Windows.

Ghostty 1.4 will continue the 6-month release cycle and is planned for September. For users interested in more frequent updates, we recommend using the [`tip` release channel](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#auto-update-channel) on macOS or [building from source](https://ghostty.org/docs/install/build) frequently on Linux.
