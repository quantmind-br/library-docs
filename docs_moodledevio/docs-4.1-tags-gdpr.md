## [FAQs](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/subsystems/privacy/faq)

My plugin sends notifications or messages to the user - do I need to return this user data?

## [Privacy API](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/subsystems/privacy)

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is an EU directive that provides users with more control over their data and how it is processed. This regulation came into effect on 25th of May 2018 and covers any citizen or permanent resident of the European Union. The directive is respected by a number of other countries outside of the European Union.

## [Utilities](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/subsystems/privacy/utils)

While implementing the privacy API into your plugin, there are CLI scripts that can help you to test things on the fly.
