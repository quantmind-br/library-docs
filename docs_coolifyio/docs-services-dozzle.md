## What is Dozzle?

Dozzle is an open-source project sponsored by Docker OSS. It is a log viewer designed to simplify monitoring and debugging containers. This lightweight, web-based application offers real-time log streaming, filtering, and searching capabilities through an intuitive user interface.

Users can quickly access logs generated by their Docker containers, making it an essential tool for debugging and troubleshooting applications in a Docker environment. By default, Dozzle supports JSON logs with intelligent color coding.

Dozzle is easy to install and configure, making it an ideal solution for developers and system administrators seeking an efficient, user-friendly log viewer for their Docker environment. The tool is available under the MIT license and is actively maintained by its developer, Amir Raminfar.
