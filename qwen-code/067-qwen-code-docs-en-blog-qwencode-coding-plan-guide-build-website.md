Need a project demonstration for your final assignment but stuck adjusting CSS until baldness? Course projects require demo videos edited until 3 AM? Want to contribute to open source projects but don’t know how to make your first PR?

Recently I tried this Qwen Code tool, initially without much hope—after all, the term “AI programming” has been overused. But upon trying it out, I realized it’s not just empty talk about “AI changing the world,” but actually saves time and lets you focus energy on more valuable things.

Let me start with the simplest example.

## Personal Portfolio Website in 5 Minutes[](#personal-portfolio-website-in-5-minutes)

Need a good resume page to showcase your portfolio when job hunting? Rather than modifying templates endlessly, let AI help you generate one.

I simply used the `@` command in Qwen Code to reference my personal resume, letting it generate a personal website with beautiful animations (simulated, PS it really looks great). Just one prompt:

```
/skills react-native-design build a personal resume website based on @resume-website/resume.md
```

👇 Result:

If you have a favorite website design, you can directly replicate it. For instance, I liked this design—

Very simple process:

1. Install web design plugin through `/extensions` in Qwen Code (supports all marketplaces)
2. Save your favorite webpage screenshot locally
3. Input prompt for it to identify layout, styles, components, and recreate runnable code

Still just one prompt:

```
/skills web-component-design design a web like @website.png
```

👇 Complete workflow:

**Suitable Scenarios:**

- Individual/team project showcase pages for final assignments
- Portfolio websites for job applications
- Club activity promotional pages
- Startup project landing pages

(Honestly, way faster than tweaking templates)

## Participate in Open Source Projects Starting With Your First PR[](#participate-in-open-source-projects-starting-with-your-first-pr)

Want to contribute to open source but unsure where to begin? Qwen Code can automate the entire process.

Give it an Issue link, and it will:

1. Automatically understand the problem description
2. Explore repository structure
3. Locate bug position
4. Provide fixing code
5. Submit PR autonomously

Zero manual intervention required. Of course, for the first time, I recommend manually reviewing the code to familiarize yourself before letting it automate completely. (Don’t ask how I know…)

Especially useful for students wanting to accumulate open source experience. You can start with simple bug fixes and gradually participate in developing more complex features.

(I sincerely suggest computer science students give it a try—open source experience genuinely helps with job hunting)

## Generate Demo Videos Using Code, Say Goodbye To Editing Software[](#generate-demo-videos-using-code-say-goodbye-to-editing-software)

Course presentations, project defenses, competition roadshows—including previous open source projects—you always need demo videos. Learning Premiere and editing videos takes so much time. (Whoever edits knows!)

Based on Remotion (a library for creating videos with React), Qwen Code can generate professional demo videos using code.

For example, to create a product introduction video:

1. Install relevant Remotion skills
2. Write scripts and storyboard descriptions
3. Let it generate video code
4. Render output

**Suitable Scenarios:**

- Course project defense videos
- Innovation entrepreneurship competition roadshows
- Club event promotions
- Automated personal Vlogs

Remotion’s advantage is that you can create videos using React components, supporting animations, transitions, subtitles, audio editing, and even version control (yes, videos can also be managed with Git—it’s pretty cool).

## How To Get Started?[](#how-to-get-started)

1. Obtain API Key from BaiLian console
2. Download Qwen Code and launch using `qwen`

```
# Linux/macOS
curl -fsSL https://qwen-code-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.sh | bash

# Windows
curl -fsSL -o %TEMP%\install-qwen.bat https://qwen-code-assets.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/installation/install-qwen.bat && %TEMP%\install-qwen.bat
```

3. Enter `/auth`, select 「Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan」, paste API Key
4. Use `/model` to choose model, then start!

Qwen Code has a skill marketplace (similar to VS Code plugin marketplace) with various ready-made skill packages. Use `/extensions` command to select and install extensions, or explore more plugins and skills.

Don’t aim for big projects right away. Start with simple scenarios such as:

- Ask AI to write a Hello World webpage
- Have it explain incomprehensible code
- Let it generate a course note template

Once familiarized, gradually attempt more complex tasks.

(This is exactly how I started, haha)

## Recommended Skill Packages For University Students[](#recommended-skill-packages-for-university-students)

Based on my experience, these skill packages are especially useful for university students:

Skill PackagePurposeSuitable Majors`skill-creator`Create skills according to standards, create your own skillsAll majors`find-skills`Discover and install new skillsAll majors`react-native-design`Quickly generate React webpagesComputer Science, Design, New Media`web-component-design`Replicate webpages from screenshotsAll majors`remotion-best-practices`Generate videos using codeJournalism, Communication, Computer Science

Installation Method:

```
npx skills add <SkillPackageName> -g
```

## Some Usage Tips[](#some-usage-tips)

1. **Don’t rely entirely on AI.** It’s a tool, not a replacement. Understand the code yourself, comprehend your homework.
2. **Start by mimicking.** When seeing someone achieve something impressive with a certain skill, mimic their prompt first, then gradually adjust into your own style.
3. **Make good use of the skill marketplace.** Most needs you think of likely already have corresponding skill packages. Search before creating, avoid reinventing wheels.
4. **Record your prompts.** Note down effective prompts for direct reuse or fine-tuning next time.
5. **Share your work.** Once you’ve created something good, share it on GitHub, Zhihu, Xiaohongshu—to both accumulate works and meet like-minded people.

## Final Thoughts[](#final-thoughts)

AI programming tools aren’t meant to replace you—they’re here to help spend your time on more valuable pursuits.

Time spent adjusting CSS until baldness can instead go toward reading more papers; late-night video editing sessions become interview preparation time; hours configuring environments transform into learning core algorithms.

Tools are there—if you choose to use them depends on you. At least now, you have another choice.

(Hopefully these experiences help, friends)
