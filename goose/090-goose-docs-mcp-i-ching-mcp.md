#### I Ching Guidance for Your Product Roadmap Decision[​](#i-ching-guidance-for-your-product-roadmap-decision "Direct link to I Ching Guidance for Your Product Roadmap Decision")

The oracle has given you **Hexagram 29 - Darkness (The Abysmal)** with a changing line in the 5th position, transforming to **Hexagram 13 - Seeking Harmony (Fellowship with Men)**.

**Key Insights for Your Team's Situation:**

**Current Challenge (Hexagram 29):**

- Your team is facing what the I Ching recognizes as a "repetition of danger" - this suggests you're in a challenging situation that requires careful navigation
- Like water in a ravine, you need to find the natural path forward rather than forcing your way through
- The emphasis is on **sincerity and thoroughness** - whatever decision you make, commit to it fully and execute it properly

**Strategic Approach:**

1. **Flow Like Water**: Don't try to overcome obstacles through force. Instead, find the path of least resistance that still moves you toward your goal
2. **Fill Every Depression**: Address all the foundational issues before moving forward. Don't skip steps or leave gaps in your planning
3. **Consistency Over Ambition**: The changing line warns against being "too ambitious." Focus on steady, sustainable progress rather than dramatic leaps

**The Transformation (Hexagram 13):** The situation naturally evolves toward **Fellowship with Men** - suggesting that the key to resolving your roadmap challenge lies in:

- **Building consensus** among team members
- **Open collaboration** rather than closed-door decisions
- **Crossing the great water** - taking on significant challenges, but doing so together

**Practical Recommendations:**

1. **Acknowledge the Difficulty**: Don't minimize the complexity of your roadmap decision. Accept that it's genuinely challenging.
2. **Seek Team Alignment**: The transformation to "Fellowship" suggests your answer lies in bringing the team together rather than having leadership decide alone.
3. **Take the Conservative Path**: The 5th line specifically advises against overambition. Choose the roadmap option that gets you "out of danger" rather than the most aggressive one.
4. **Focus on Execution**: Once you decide, commit fully. The hexagram emphasizes that success comes from thorough implementation, not perfect strategy.

The I Ching suggests this challenging decision will ultimately strengthen your team's unity and collaboration if approached with patience, sincerity, and collective wisdom.
