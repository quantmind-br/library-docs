## macOS Developer Setup

This guide covers the necessary steps to build and run the OpenClaw macOS application from source.

## Prerequisites

Before building the app, ensure you have the following installed:

1. **Xcode 26.2+**: Required for Swift development.
2. **Node.js 22+ & pnpm**: Required for the gateway, CLI, and packaging scripts.

## 1. Install Dependencies

Install the project-wide dependencies:

## 2. Build and Package the App

To build the macOS app and package it into `dist/OpenClaw.app`, run:

```
./scripts/package-mac-app.sh
```

If you don’t have an Apple Developer ID certificate, the script will automatically use **ad-hoc signing** (`-`). For dev run modes, signing flags, and Team ID troubleshooting, see the macOS app README: [https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/apps/macos/README.md](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/apps/macos/README.md)

> **Note**: Ad-hoc signed apps may trigger security prompts. If the app crashes immediately with “Abort trap 6”, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

## 3. Install the CLI

The macOS app expects a global `openclaw` CLI install to manage background tasks. **To install it (recommended):**

1. Open the OpenClaw app.
2. Go to the **General** settings tab.
3. Click **“Install CLI”**.

Alternatively, install it manually:

```
npm install -g openclaw@<version>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails: Toolchain or SDK Mismatch

The macOS app build expects the latest macOS SDK and Swift 6.2 toolchain. **System dependencies (required):**

- **Latest macOS version available in Software Update** (required by Xcode 26.2 SDKs)
- **Xcode 26.2** (Swift 6.2 toolchain)

**Checks:**

```
xcodebuild -version
xcrun swift --version
```

If versions don’t match, update macOS/Xcode and re-run the build.

### App Crashes on Permission Grant

If the app crashes when you try to allow **Speech Recognition** or **Microphone** access, it may be due to a corrupted TCC cache or signature mismatch. **Fix:**

1. Reset the TCC permissions:
   
   ```
   tccutil reset All bot.molt.mac.debug
   ```
2. If that fails, change the `BUNDLE_ID` temporarily in [`scripts/package-mac-app.sh`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/scripts/package-mac-app.sh) to force a “clean slate” from macOS.

### Gateway “Starting…” indefinitely

If the gateway status stays on “Starting…”, check if a zombie process is holding the port:

```
openclaw gateway status
openclaw gateway stop

# If you’re not using a LaunchAgent (dev mode / manual runs), find the listener:
lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN
```

If a manual run is holding the port, stop that process (Ctrl+C). As a last resort, kill the PID you found above.
