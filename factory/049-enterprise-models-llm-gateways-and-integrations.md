Factory is designed to plug into the **AI and developer tooling you already use**. This page explains how to control which models Droid can use, how to route traffic through LLM gateways, and how to manage MCP servers, droids, commands, and platform integrations.

## Model management and hierarchy

Model access is governed by the same hierarchical settings system used throughout Factory:

- **Org level**
  
  - Defines the **authoritative list of allowed models** and categories.
  - Can explicitly ban models (for example, non‑enterprise APIs) so they cannot be re‑enabled by projects or users.
  - Decides whether user‑supplied BYOK keys are allowed at all.
- **Project level**
  
  - Can **add additional models** on top of the org‑approved set (for example, project‑specific fine‑tunes) but cannot re‑enable banned ones.
  - Can set project defaults—for example, “use a small model for tests, a large model for refactors.”
- **User level**
  
  - Can choose personal defaults **within the allowed set**.
  - Cannot see or select models that higher levels have disallowed.

Because the hierarchy is extension‑only, upgrades and policy changes at the org level flow consistently across all environments.

Many enterprises centralize model access behind an **LLM gateway** that handles authentication, routing, and policy enforcement. Factory works with gateways in two ways:

1. **Directly configured gateway endpoints**
   
   - `.factory/settings.json` can specify gateway base URLs for specific providers.
   - Environment variables can route calls (for example, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`).
   - Custom models configured via [BYOK](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/byok) can point to gateway endpoints using `base_url` and provider‑specific settings, so the same gateway policy applies whether models are built‑in or custom.
2. **Org‑level gateway policy**
   
   - Org admins can require that all model traffic go through specific gateways.
   - BYOK can be restricted so that only centrally managed keys and identities are used.

When you use a gateway, **data handling and retention policies are those of the gateway and underlying providers**; Droid simply uses the endpoints and credentials you configure. For concrete examples of configuring custom models (including gateway‑backed models), see [Custom models & BYOK](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/configuration/byok), which covers the `customModels` array in `~/.factory/settings.json` and how those models appear in the `/model` selector.

## Cloud providers and BYOK

Factory supports multiple model deployment patterns:

- **Direct cloud providers** – calling OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others using your enterprise credentials.
- **Cloud AI platforms** – AWS Bedrock, GCP Vertex, Azure OpenAI, using IAM‑backed authentication.
- **On‑prem / self‑hosted models** – models running inside your network, exposed via approved gateways.

Bring‑your‑own‑key (BYOK) is controlled by policy:

- Org admins can allow or block **user‑supplied API keys**.
- Even when BYOK is allowed, orgs can restrict which providers and endpoints keys may target.
- Project configs can define shared keys or credentials for team‑wide models in secure stores.

In high‑security environments, orgs often:

- Disable user BYOK entirely.
- Route all traffic through gateways that enforce data residency and audit logging.

## MCP servers

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** lets Droid access external systems—ticket queues, documentation, databases, and more—through well‑defined tools. MCP servers can be very powerful; they may read from internal systems or perform side‑effecting actions. Factory gives you several levers to control them:

- **Org allowlist/blocklist**
  
  - Org admins define which MCP servers are allowed at all.
  - Servers not on the allowlist are ignored, even if a project tries to configure them.
- **Project‑level configuration**
  
  - Projects can enable subsets of the allowed servers and configure environment variables and connection details.
- **User‑level opt‑in**
  
  - Users can enable or disable MCP servers from the allowed set for their own sessions.

These controls let you safely expose internal systems to Droid while ensuring each server has passed security and compliance review.

Factory’s ecosystem of **droids, commands, and hooks** is also governed hierarchically.

### Org‑level droids and commands

- Org admins can publish **blessed droids** and **shared commands** into an org‑level `.factory` bundle.
- These often encode security‑reviewed workflows such as:
  
  - `/security-review`
  - `/migrate-service`
  - `/refactor-module`
- Projects and users can use these resources but cannot modify them.

### Project‑level extensions

- Projects add **specialized droids and commands** in their own `.factory/droids/` and `.factory/commands/` directories.
- These extend org resources with project‑specific logic—such as knowledge of particular services, schemas, or runbooks.

### User‑level customization

- Users can add personal droids and commands in `~/.factory/droids/` and `~/.factory/commands/`.
- These are useful for individual workflows but must still respect org and project policies (for example, cannot call disallowed tools or models).

Hooks tie everything together by providing enforcement and logging at the edges of these tools. See [LLM Safety & Agent Controls](https://docs.factory.ai/enterprise/llm-safety-and-agent-controls) for more.

## Integration environments

Because Droid is CLI‑first, it integrates with many environments without forcing developers into a particular IDE. Common patterns include:

- **Terminals and shells**
  
  - Direct use of Droid in `bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, or Windows shells.
  - Shell aliases and scripts to standardize workflows across teams.
- **IDE and editor integrations**
  
  - Integrations with IDEs such as VS Code, JetBrains tools, and others that treat Droid as a backend agent.
  - Policies and telemetry still flow through the same hierarchical settings and OTEL pipelines.
- **CI/CD pipelines**
  
  - Running Droid in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or internal pipelines for tasks like code review, refactoring, and migration.
  - Use separate identities and credentials for CI compared to developers.
- **Remote and locked-down environments**
  
  - Running Droid in air-gapped or restricted environments.
  - Supporting desktop and browser-based interfaces for secure enterprise deployments.

Across all of these, the same enterprise controls apply: **models, tools, MCP servers, and telemetry are constrained by org and project policy, not by the IDE or environment**.
