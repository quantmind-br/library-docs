# Dynamic Configurations

Dynamic configurations are used to configure Traefik on the fly, without restarting it.

You can add them by going to the `Server/Proxy` view, and select `Dynamic Configurations` from the sidebar.

::: tip Tip
Some of the dynamic configurations cannot be deleted, as they required for
Coolify itself.
