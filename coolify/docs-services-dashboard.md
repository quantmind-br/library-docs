## What is Dashboard?

Dashboard is just that - a dashboard. It's inspired by [SUI](https://github.com/jeroenpardon/sui) and has all the same features as SUI, such as simple customization through JSON-files and a handy search bar to search the internet more efficiently.

## Features

So what makes this project different from (or even better than) SUI?

* "Display URL" functionality (The URL displayed for apps can differ from the actual URL)
* Categorization for apps
* Themes and search providers can be changed using JSON
* Imprint functionality
