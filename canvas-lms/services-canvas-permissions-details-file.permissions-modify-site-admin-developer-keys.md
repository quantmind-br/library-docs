## Developer Keys - modify Site Admin developer keys

Allows user to create, modify, and delete global (Site Admin) developer keys and LTI configurations.

This permission controls access to Site Admin developer keys that are inherited by all accounts. Root Account-level keys are unaffected.

### Additional Considerations

Developer Keys - manage must also be enabled to access the Developer Keys page.

This permission is only available in Site Admin and controls access to global developer keys.
