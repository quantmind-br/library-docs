OpenCode’s share feature allows you to create public links to your OpenCode conversations, so you can collaborate with teammates or get help from others.

* * *

## [How it works](#how-it-works)

When you share a conversation, OpenCode:

1. Creates a unique public URL for your session
2. Syncs your conversation history to our servers
3. Makes the conversation accessible via the shareable link — `opncd.ai/s/<share-id>`

* * *

## [Sharing](#sharing)

OpenCode supports three sharing modes that control how conversations are shared:

* * *

### [Manual (default)](#manual-default)

By default, OpenCode uses manual sharing mode. Sessions are not shared automatically, but you can manually share them using the `/share` command:

This will generate a unique URL that’ll be copied to your clipboard.

To explicitly set manual mode in your [config file](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

```

{
"$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",
"share": "manual"
}
```

* * *

You can enable automatic sharing for all new conversations by setting the `share` option to `"auto"` in your [config file](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

```

{
"$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",
"share": "auto"
}
```

With auto-share enabled, every new conversation will automatically be shared and a link will be generated.

* * *

### [Disabled](#disabled)

You can disable sharing entirely by setting the `share` option to `"disabled"` in your [config file](https://opencode.ai/docs/config):

```

{
"$schema": "https://opncd.ai/config.json",
"share": "disabled"
}
```

To enforce this across your team for a given project, add it to the `opencode.json` in your project and check into Git.

* * *

## [Un-sharing](#un-sharing)

To stop sharing a conversation and remove it from public access:

This will remove the share link and delete the data related to the conversation.

* * *

## [Privacy](#privacy)

There are a few things to keep in mind when sharing a conversation.

* * *

### [Data retention](#data-retention)

Shared conversations remain accessible until you explicitly unshare them. This includes:

- Full conversation history
- All messages and responses
- Session metadata

* * *

### [Recommendations](#recommendations)

- Only share conversations that don’t contain sensitive information.
- Review conversation content before sharing.
- Unshare conversations when collaboration is complete.
- Avoid sharing conversations with proprietary code or confidential data.
- For sensitive projects, disable sharing entirely.

* * *

## [For enterprises](#for-enterprises)

For enterprise deployments, the share feature can be:

- **Disabled** entirely for security compliance
- **Restricted** to users authenticated through SSO only
- **Self-hosted** on your own infrastructure
