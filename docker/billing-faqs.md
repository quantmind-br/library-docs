## Billing FAQs

Table of contents

* * *

### [What happens if my subscription payment fails?](#what-happens-if-my-subscription-payment-fails)

If your subscription payment fails, there is a grace period of 15 days, including the due date. Docker retries to collect the payment 3 times using the following schedule:

- 3 days after the due date
- 5 days after the previous attempt
- 7 days after the previous attempt

Docker also sends an email notification `Action Required - Credit Card Payment Failed` with an attached unpaid invoice after each failed payment attempt.

Once the grace period is over and the invoice is still not paid, the subscription downgrades to a free subscription and all paid features are disabled.

### [Can I manually retry a failed payment?](#can-i-manually-retry-a-failed-payment)

No. Docker retries failed payments on a [retry schedule](https://docs.docker.com/billing/faqs/#what-happens-if-my-subscription-payment-fails).

To ensure a retired payment is successful, verify your default payment is updated. If you need to update your default payment method, see [Manage payment method](https://docs.docker.com/billing/payment-method/#manage-payment-method).

### [Does Docker collect sales tax and/or VAT?](#does-docker-collect-sales-tax-andor-vat)

Docker collects sales tax and/or VAT from the following:

- For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024.
- For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025.
- For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your billing information and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. See [Update the billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/).

If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

### [Does Docker offer academic pricing?](#does-docker-offer-academic-pricing)

For academic pricing, contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact).

### [Can I use pay by invoice for upgrades or additional seats?](#can-i-use-pay-by-invoice-for-upgrades-or-additional-seats)

No. Pay by invoice is only available for renewing annual subscriptions, not for purchasing upgrades or additional seats. You must use card payment or US bank accounts for these changes.

For a list of supported payment methods, see [Add or update a payment method](https://docs.docker.com/billing/payment-method/).
