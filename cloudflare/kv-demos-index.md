Learn how you can use KV within your existing application and architecture.

## Demo applications

Explore the following demo applications for KV.

* [shrty.dev:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/shorty-dot-dev) A URL shortener that makes use of KV and Workers Analytics Engine. The admin interface uses Function Calling. Go Shorty!
* [Queues Web Crawler:](https://github.com/cloudflare/queues-web-crawler) An example use-case for Queues, a web crawler built on Browser Rendering and Puppeteer. The crawler finds the number of links to Cloudflare.com on the site, and archives a screenshot to Workers KV.
