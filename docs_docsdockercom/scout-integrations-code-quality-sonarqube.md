## Integrate Docker Scout with SonarQube

The SonarQube integration enables Docker Scout to surface SonarQube quality gate checks through Policy Evaluation, under a new [SonarQube Quality Gates Policy](https://docs.docker.com/scout/policy/#sonarqube-quality-gates-policy).

## [How it works](#how-it-works)

This integration uses [SonarQube webhooks](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/project-administration/webhooks/) to notify Docker Scout of when a SonarQube project analysis has completed. When the webhook is called, Docker Scout receives the analysis results, and stores them in the database.

When you push a new image to a repository, Docker Scout evaluates the results of the SonarQube analysis record corresponding to the image. Docker Scout uses Git provenance metadata on the images, from provenance attestations or an OCI annotations, to link image repositories with SonarQube analysis results.

> Note
> 
> Docker Scout doesn't have access to historic SonarQube analysis records. Only analysis results recorded after the integration is enabled will be available to Docker Scout.

Both self-managed SonarQube instances and SonarCloud are supported.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

To integrate Docker Scout with SonarQube, ensure that:

- Your image repository is [integrated with Docker Scout](https://docs.docker.com/scout/integrations/#container-registries).
- Your images are built with [provenance attestations](https://docs.docker.com/build/metadata/attestations/slsa-provenance/), or the `org.opencontainers.image.revision` annotation, containing information about the Git repository.

## [Enable the SonarQube integration](#enable-the-sonarqube-integration)

1. Go to the [SonarQube integrations page](https://scout.docker.com/settings/integrations/sonarqube/) on the Docker Scout Dashboard.
2. In the **How to integrate** section, enter a configuration name for this integration. Docker Scout uses this label as a display name for the integration, and to name the webhook.
3. Select **Next**.
4. Enter the configuration details for your SonarQube instance. Docker Scout uses this information to create SonarQube webhook.
   
   In SonarQube, [generate a new **User token**](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarqube/latest/user-guide/user-account/generating-and-using-tokens/#generating-a-token). The token requires 'Administer' permission on the specified project, or global 'Administer' permission.
   
   Enter the token, your SonarQube URL, and the ID of your SonarQube organization. The SonarQube organization is required if you're using SonarCloud.
5. Select **Enable configuration**.
   
   Docker Scout performs a connection test to verify that the provided details are correct, and that the token has the necessary permissions.
6. After a successful connection test, you're redirected to the SonarQube integration overview, which lists all your SonarQube integrations and their statuses.

From the integration overview page, you can go directly to the **SonarQube Quality Gates Policy**. This policy will have no results initially. To start seeing evaluation results for this policy, trigger a new SonarQube analysis of your project and push the corresponding image to a repository. For more information, refer to the [policy description](https://docs.docker.com/scout/policy/#sonarqube-quality-gates).
