# Services

## What are Services?

Services in Coolify are deployments based on **Docker Compose files** that are stored directly on your server. Unlike [Applications](/applications/introduction), Services are **not connected to a Git source** — they don't pull code from a repository or rebuild on commits.

There are two types of Services in Coolify:

### User-Defined Services

These are Docker Compose files that **you manually provide**. You can paste your own `docker-compose.yml` configuration directly into Coolify, and it will deploy and manage it for you. This gives you complete flexibility to deploy any containerized application or stack that you've configured yourself.

To do so, you select the `Docker Compose Empty` option when creating a new Resource.

### One-Click Services

One-Click Services are a curated collection of 200+ popular open-source applications and tools that you can deploy instantly with just a few clicks. These are **pre-configured Docker Compose templates** provided by Coolify, eliminating the complexity of manual setup and configuration.

Instead of writing your own compose file from scratch, you can select from ready-to-use templates that are automatically filled in for you, making self-hosting accessible to everyone.

#### How They Work

Each template has been:

* **Pre-tested and optimized** for reliable deployment
* **Configured with sensible defaults** to work out of the box
* **Integrated with Coolify's features** like automatic SSL and backups

#### What's Included

Our service library includes a wide variety of applications developed by the open-source community:

* **Development Tools**: Code editors, Git platforms, CI/CD solutions
* **Productivity Apps**: Project management, note-taking, collaboration tools
* **Media & Entertainment**: Media servers, photo management, streaming platforms
* **Business Applications**: CRM systems, accounting software, e-commerce platforms
* **Databases & Analytics**: Various database engines, monitoring, and analytics tools
* **Communication**: Chat platforms, email servers, forums
* **And many more...**

#### Key Benefits

* **Instant Deployment**: No need to write Docker Compose files from scratch
* **Automatic Updates**: Services can be updated with a single click
* **Integrated Features**: Automatic SSL certificates and backups
* **Community Tested**: All services are tested and maintained by the community
* **Full Control**: You maintain complete control over your data and infrastructure

#### Contributing New Services
