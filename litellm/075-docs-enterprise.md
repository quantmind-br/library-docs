## Self-Hosted[​](#self-hosted "Direct link to Self-Hosted")

Manage Yourself - you can deploy our Docker Image or build a custom image from our pip package, and manage your own infrastructure. In this case, we would give you a license key + provide support via a dedicated support channel.

### What’s the cost of the Self-Managed Enterprise edition?[​](#whats-the-cost-of-the-self-managed-enterprise-edition "Direct link to What’s the cost of the Self-Managed Enterprise edition?")

Self-Managed Enterprise deployments require our team to understand your exact needs. [Get in touch with us to learn more](https://calendly.com/d/4mp-gd3-k5k/litellm-1-1-onboarding-chat)

### How does deployment with Enterprise License work?[​](#how-does-deployment-with-enterprise-license-work "Direct link to How does deployment with Enterprise License work?")

You just deploy [our docker image](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/deploy) and get an enterprise license key to add to your environment to unlock additional functionality (SSO, etc.).

**No data leaves your environment.**

## Hosted LiteLLM Proxy[​](#hosted-litellm-proxy "Direct link to Hosted LiteLLM Proxy")

LiteLLM maintains the proxy, so you can focus on your core products.

We provide a dedicated proxy for your team, and manage the infrastructure.

### **Status**: GA[​](#status-ga "Direct link to status-ga")

Our proxy is already used in production by customers.

See our status page for [**live reliability**](https://status.litellm.ai/)

### **Benefits**[​](#benefits "Direct link to benefits")

- **No Maintenance, No Infra**: We'll maintain the proxy, and spin up any additional infrastructure (e.g.: separate server for spend logs) to make sure you can load balance + track spend across multiple LLM projects.
- **Reliable**: Our hosted proxy is tested on 1k requests per second, making it reliable for high load.
- **Secure**: LiteLLM is SOC-2 Type 2 and ISO 27001 certified, to make sure your data is as secure as possible.

- 24h for Sev2-Sev3 between 7am – 7pm PT (Monday through Saturday) - setup issues e.g. Redis working on our end, but not on your infrastructure.
