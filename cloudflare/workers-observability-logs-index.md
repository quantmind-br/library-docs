Logs are an important component of a developer's toolkit to troubleshoot and diagnose application issues and maintaining system health. The Cloudflare Developer Platform offers many tools to help developers manage their application's logs.

## [Workers Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/workers-logs)

Automatically ingest, filter, and analyze logs emitted from Cloudflare Workers in the Cloudflare dashboard.

## [Real-time logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/real-time-logs)

Access log events in near real-time. Real-time logs provide immediate feedback and visibility into the health of your Cloudflare Worker.

## [Tail Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/tail-workers) Beta

Tail Workers allow developers to apply custom filtering, sampling, and transformation logic to telemetry data.

## [Workers Logpush](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/logpush)

Send Workers Trace Event Logs to a supported destination. Workers Logpush includes metadata about requests and responses, unstructured `console.log()` messages and any uncaught exceptions.
