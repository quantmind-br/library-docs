## What is MetaMCP?

MetaMCP is an MCP aggregator/orchestrator that lets you group multiple MCP servers into namespaces, apply middleware, and expose a single unified endpoint. It supports SSE and Streamable HTTP transports (plus OpenAPI), works with popular MCP clients, and is built to simplify composing tools and hosting them behind API key or OAuth-based access.
