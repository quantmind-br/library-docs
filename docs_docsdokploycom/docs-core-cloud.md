Deploy your apps to multiple servers remotely without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

Dokploy Cloud allows you to deploy your apps to a cloud provider of your choice. This means that you can deploy your apps to any cloud provider, such as AWS, GCP, Azure, or DigitalOcean, without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

By default when you install Dokploy in a Self Hosted version, if you deploy all your applications by default they will be deployed on the same server where Dokploy UI is installed. This means that you will need to build and run your applications where Dokploy UI is installed, which can be a challenge if you don't have the resources to do so, also self hosted support for remote instances.

Dokploy cloud starts from $4.50 per month per server, the next is 3.50$, and you can deploy as many applications you want to your remote server connected to a dokploy cloud, multi server feature is recommended for HA and scalability projects.

You can start by registering on the [Dokploy Cloud](https://app.dokploy.com) website and follow the steps to deploy your apps, see the [Pricing](https://dokploy.com#pricing) page for more information.
