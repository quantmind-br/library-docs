Manage exec approvals for the **local host**, **gateway host**, or a **node host**. By default, commands target the local approvals file on disk. Use `--gateway` to target the gateway, or `--node` to target a specific node. Related:

- Nodes: [Nodes](https://docs.openclaw.ai/nodes)

## Common commands

```
openclaw approvals get
openclaw approvals get --node <id|name|ip>
openclaw approvals get --gateway
```

## Replace approvals from a file

```
openclaw approvals set --file ./exec-approvals.json
openclaw approvals set --node <id|name|ip> --file ./exec-approvals.json
openclaw approvals set --gateway --file ./exec-approvals.json
```

## Allowlist helpers

```
openclaw approvals allowlist add "~/Projects/**/bin/rg"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent main --node <id|name|ip> "/usr/bin/uptime"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --agent "*" "/usr/bin/uname"

openclaw approvals allowlist remove "~/Projects/**/bin/rg"
```

## Notes

- `--node` uses the same resolver as `openclaw nodes` (id, name, ip, or id prefix).
- `--agent` defaults to `"*"`, which applies to all agents.
- The node host must advertise `system.execApprovals.get/set` (macOS app or headless node host).
- Approvals files are stored per host at `~/.openclaw/exec-approvals.json`.
