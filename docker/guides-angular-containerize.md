## Containerize an Angular Application

Before you begin, make sure the following tools are installed and available on your system:

- You have installed the latest version of [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
- You have a [git client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). The examples in this section use a command-line based git client, but you can use any client.

> **New to Docker?**  
> Start with the [Docker basics](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/the-basics/what-is-a-container/) guide to get familiar with key concepts like images, containers, and Dockerfiles.

* * *

This guide walks you through the complete process of containerizing an Angular application with Docker. You’ll learn how to create a production-ready Docker image using best practices that improve performance, security, scalability, and deployment efficiency.

By the end of this guide, you will:

- Containerize an Angular application using Docker.
- Create and optimize a Dockerfile for production builds.
- Use multi-stage builds to minimize image size.
- Serve the application efficiently with a custom Nginx configuration.
- Build secure and maintainable Docker images by following best practices.

* * *

Clone the sample application to use with this guide. Open a terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to work, and run the following command to clone the git repository:

* * *

Docker provides an interactive CLI tool called `docker init` that helps scaffold the necessary configuration files for containerizing your application. This includes generating a `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `compose.yaml`, and `README.Docker.md`.

To begin, navigate to the root of your project directory:

Then run the following command:

You’ll see output similar to:

The CLI will prompt you with a few questions about your app setup. For consistency, please use the same responses shown in the example below when prompted:

QuestionAnswerWhat application platform does your project use?NodeWhat version of Node do you want to use?24.12.0-alpineWhich package manager do you want to use?npmDo you want to run "npm run build" before starting server?yesWhat directory is your build output to?distWhat command do you want to use to start the app?npm run startWhat port does your server listen on?8080

After completion, your project directory will contain the following new files:

* * *

The default Dockerfile generated by `docker init` serves as a solid starting point for general Node.js applications. However, Angular is a front-end framework that compiles into static assets, so we need to tailor the Dockerfile to optimize for how Angular applications are built and served in a production environment.

### [Step 1: Improve the generated Dockerfile and configuration](#step-1-improve-the-generated-dockerfile-and-configuration)

In this step, you’ll improve the Dockerfile and configuration files by following best practices:

- Use multi-stage builds to keep the final image clean and small
- Serve the app using Nginx, a fast and secure web server
- Improve performance and security by only including what’s needed

These updates help ensure your app is easy to deploy, fast to load, and production-ready.

> A `Dockerfile` is a plain text file that contains step-by-step instructions to build a Docker image. It automates packaging your application along with its dependencies and runtime environment.  
> For full details, see the [Dockerfile reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/).

### [Step 2: Configure the Dockerfile](#step-2-configure-the-dockerfile)

Before creating a Dockerfile, you need to choose a base image. You can either use the [Node.js Official Image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) or a Docker Hardened Image (DHI) from the [Hardened Image catalog](https://hub.docker.com/hardened-images/catalog).

Choosing DHI offers the advantage of a production-ready image that is lightweight and secure. For more information, see [Docker Hardened Images](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/).

> This guide uses a stable Node.js LTS image tag that is considered secure when the guide is written. Because new releases and security patches are published regularly, the tag shown here may no longer be the safest option when you follow the guide. Always review the latest available image tags and select a secure, up-to-date version before building or deploying your application.
> 
> Official Node.js Docker Images: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/node](https://hub.docker.com/_/node)

Docker Hardened Images (DHIs) are available for Node.js in the [Docker Hardened Images catalog](https://hub.docker.com/hardened-images/catalog/dhi/node). Docker Hardened Images are freely available to everyone with no subscription required. You can pull and use them like any other Docker image after signing in to the DHI registry. For more information, see the [DHI quickstart](https://docs.docker.com/dhi/get-started/) guide.

1. Sign in to the DHI registry:
2. Pull the Node.js DHI (check the catalog for available versions):

In the following Dockerfile, the `FROM` instruction uses `dhi.io/node:24-alpine3.22-dev` as the base image.

Now you need to create a production-ready multi-stage Dockerfile. Replace the generated Dockerfile with the following optimized configuration:

> We are using nginx-unprivileged instead of the standard Nginx image to follow security best practices. Running as a non-root user in the final image:
> 
> - Reduces the attack surface
> - Aligns with Docker’s recommendations for container hardening
> - Helps comply with stricter security policies in production environments

### [Step 3: Configure the .dockerignore file](#step-3-configure-the-dockerignore-file)

The `.dockerignore` file tells Docker which files and folders to exclude when building the image.

> This helps:
> 
> - Reduce image size
> - Speed up the build process
> - Prevent sensitive or unnecessary files (like `.env`, `.git`, or `node_modules`) from being added to the final image.
> 
> To learn more, visit the [.dockerignore reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#dockerignore-file).

Copy and replace the contents of your existing `.dockerignore` with the configuration below:

### [Step 4: Create the `nginx.conf` file](#step-4-create-the-nginxconf-file)

To serve your Angular application efficiently inside the container, you’ll configure Nginx with a custom setup. This configuration is optimized for performance, browser caching, gzip compression, and support for client-side routing.

Create a file named `nginx.conf` in the root of your project directory, and add the following content:

> To learn more about configuring Nginx, see the [official Nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/).

### [Step 5: Build the Angular application image](#step-5-build-the-angular-application-image)

With your custom configuration in place, you're now ready to build the Docker image for your Angular application.

The updated setup includes:

- The updated setup includes a clean, production-ready Nginx configuration tailored specifically for Angular.
- Efficient multi-stage Docker build, ensuring a small and secure final image.

After completing the previous steps, your project directory should now contain the following files:

Now that your Dockerfile is configured, you can build the Docker image for your Angular application.

> The `docker build` command packages your application into an image using the instructions in the Dockerfile. It includes all necessary files from the current directory (called the [build context](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#what-is-a-build-context)).

Run the following command from the root of your project:

What this command does:

- Uses the Dockerfile in the current directory (.)
- Packages the application and its dependencies into a Docker image
- Tags the image as docker-angular-sample so you can reference it later

#### [Step 6: View local images](#step-6--view-local-images)

After building your Docker image, you can check which images are available on your local machine using either the Docker CLI or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/use-desktop/images/). Since you're already working in the terminal, let's use the Docker CLI.

To list all locally available Docker images, run the following command:

Example Output:

This output provides key details about your images:

- **Repository** – The name assigned to the image.
- **Tag** – A version label that helps identify different builds (e.g., latest).
- **Image ID** – A unique identifier for the image.
- **Created** – The timestamp indicating when the image was built.
- **Size** – The total disk space used by the image.

If the build was successful, you should see `docker-angular-sample` image listed.

* * *

In the previous step, you created a Dockerfile for your Angular application and built a Docker image using the docker build command. Now it’s time to run that image in a container and verify that your application works as expected.

Inside the `docker-angular-sample` directory, run the following command in a terminal.

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a simple Angular web application.

Press `ctrl+c` in the terminal to stop your application.

### [Run the application in the background](#run-the-application-in-the-background)

You can run the application detached from the terminal by adding the `-d` option. Inside the `docker-angular-sample` directory, run the following command in a terminal.

Open a browser and view the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your Angular application running in the browser.

To confirm that the container is running, use `docker ps` command:

This will list all active containers along with their ports, names, and status. Look for a container exposing port 8080.

Example Output:

To stop the application, run:

> For more information about Compose commands, see the [Compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/compose/).

In this guide, you learned how to containerize, build, and run an Angular application using Docker. By following best practices, you created a secure, optimized, and production-ready setup.

What you accomplished:

- Initialized your project using `docker init` to scaffold essential Docker configuration files.
- Replaced the default `Dockerfile` with a multi-stage build that compiles the Angular application and serves the static files using Nginx.
- Replaced the default `.dockerignore` file to exclude unnecessary files and keep the image clean and efficient.
- Built your Docker image using `docker build`.
- Ran the container using `docker compose up`, both in the foreground and in detached mode.
- Verified that the app was running by visiting [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- Learned how to stop the containerized application using `docker compose down`.

You now have a fully containerized Angular application, running in a Docker container, and ready for deployment across any environment with confidence and consistency.
