Types that pin data to a location in memory.

It is sometimes useful to be able to rely upon a certain value not being able to *move*, in the sense that its address in memory cannot change. This is useful especially when there are one or more [*pointers*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.pointer.html "primitive pointer") pointing at that value. The ability to rely on this guarantee that the value a [pointer](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.pointer.html "primitive pointer") is pointing at (its **pointee**) will

1. Not be *moved* out of its memory location
2. More generally, remain *valid* at that same memory location

is called “pinning.” We would say that a value which satisfies these guarantees has been “pinned,” in that it has been permanently (until the end of its lifespan) attached to its location in memory, as though pinned to a pinboard. Pinning a value is an incredibly useful building block for [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code to be able to reason about whether a raw pointer to the pinned value is still valid. [As we’ll see later](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee "mod std::pin"), once a value is pinned, it is necessarily valid at its memory location until the end of its lifespan. This concept of “pinning” is necessary to implement safe interfaces on top of things like self-referential types and intrusive data structures which cannot currently be modeled in fully safe Rust using only borrow-checked [references](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference").

“Pinning” allows us to put a *value* which exists at some location in memory into a state where safe code cannot *move* that value to a different location in memory or otherwise invalidate it at its current location (unless it implements [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"), which we will [talk about below](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#unpin "mod std::pin")). Anything that wants to interact with the pinned value in a way that has the potential to violate these guarantees must promise that it will not actually violate them, using the [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") keyword to mark that such a promise is upheld by the user and not the compiler. In this way, we can allow other [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code to rely on any pointers that point to the pinned value to be valid to dereference while it is pinned.

Note that as long as you don’t use [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe"), it’s impossible to create or misuse a pinned value in a way that is unsound. See the documentation of [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") for more information on the practicalities of how to pin a value and how to use that pinned value from a user’s perspective without using [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe").

The rest of this documentation is intended to be the source of truth for users of [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") that are implementing the [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") pieces of an interface that relies on pinning for validity; users of [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") in safe code do not need to read it in detail.

- [Subtle details and the `Drop` guarantee](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee "mod std::pin")

## [§](#what-is-moving)What is “*moving*”?

When we say a value is *moved*, we mean that the compiler copies, byte-for-byte, the value from one location to another. In a purely mechanical sense, this is identical to [`Copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Copy.html "trait std::marker::Copy")ing a value from one place in memory to another. In Rust, “move” carries with it the semantics of ownership transfer from one variable to another, which is the key difference between a [`Copy`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Copy.html "trait std::marker::Copy") and a move. For the purposes of this module’s documentation, however, when we write *move* in italics, we mean *specifically* that the value has *moved* in the mechanical sense of being located at a new place in memory.

All values in Rust are trivially *moveable*. This means that the address at which a value is located is not necessarily stable in between borrows. The compiler is allowed to *move* a value to a new address without running any code to notify that value that its address has changed. Although the compiler will not insert memory *moves* where no semantic move has occurred, there are many places where a value *may* be moved. For example, when doing assignment or passing a value into a function.

```rust
#[derive(Default)]
struct AddrTracker(Option<usize>);

impl AddrTracker {
    // If we haven't checked the addr of self yet, store the current
    // address. If we have, confirm that the current address is the same
    // as it was last time, or else panic.
    fn check_for_move(&mut self) {
        let current_addr = self as *mut Self as usize;
        match self.0 {
            None => self.0 = Some(current_addr),
            Some(prev_addr) => assert_eq!(prev_addr, current_addr),
        }
    }
}

// Create a tracker and store the initial address
let mut tracker = AddrTracker::default();
tracker.check_for_move();

// Here we shadow the variable. This carries a semantic move, and may therefore also
// come with a mechanical memory *move*
let mut tracker = tracker;

// May panic!
// tracker.check_for_move();
```

In this sense, Rust does not guarantee that `check_for_move()` will never panic, because the compiler is permitted to *move* `tracker` in many situations.

Common smart-pointer types such as [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) and [`&mut T`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference") also allow *moving* the underlying *value* they point at: you can move out of a [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html), or you can use [`mem::replace`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.replace.html "fn std::mem::replace") to move a `T` out of a [`&mut T`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference"). Therefore, putting a value (such as `tracker` above) behind a pointer isn’t enough on its own to ensure that its address does not change.

## [§](#what-is-pinning)What is “pinning”?

We say that a value has been *pinned* when it has been put into a state where it is guaranteed to remain *located at the same place in memory* from the time it is pinned until its [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") is called.

### [§](#address-sensitive-values-aka-when-we-need-pinning)Address-sensitive values, AKA “when we need pinning”

Most values in Rust are entirely okay with being *moved* around at-will. Types for which it is *always* the case that *any* value of that type can be *moved* at-will should implement [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"), which we will discuss more [below](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#unpin "mod std::pin").

[`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") is specifically targeted at allowing the implementation of *safe interfaces* around types which have some state during which they become “address-sensitive.” A value in such an “address-sensitive” state is *not* okay with being *moved* around at-will. Such a value must stay *un-moved* and valid during the address-sensitive portion of its lifespan because some interface is relying on those invariants to be true in order for its implementation to be sound.

As a motivating example of a type which may become address-sensitive, consider a type which contains a pointer to another piece of its own data, *i.e.* a “self-referential” type. In order for such a type to be implemented soundly, the pointer which points into `self`’s data must be proven valid whenever it is accessed. But if that value is *moved*, the pointer will still point to the old address where the value was located and not into the new location of `self`, thus becoming invalid. A key example of such self-referential types are the state machines generated by the compiler to implement [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future") for `async fn`s.

Such types that have an *address-sensitive* state usually follow a lifecycle that looks something like so:

1. A value is created which can be freely moved around.
   
   - e.g. calling an async function which returns a state machine implementing [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future")
2. An operation causes the value to depend on its own address not changing
   
   - e.g. calling [`poll`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll "future::Future::poll") for the first time on the produced [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future")
3. Further pieces of the safe interface of the type use internal [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") operations which assume that the address of the value is stable
   
   - e.g. subsequent calls to [`poll`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll "future::Future::poll")
4. Before the value is invalidated (e.g. deallocated), it is *dropped*, giving it a chance to notify anything with pointers to itself that those pointers will be invalidated
   
   - e.g. [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop")ping the [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future") [1](#fn1)

There are two possible ways to ensure the invariants required for 2. and 3. above (which apply to any address-sensitive type, not just self-referential types) do not get broken.

1. Have the value detect when it is moved and update all the pointers that point to itself.
2. Guarantee that the address of the value does not change (and that memory is not re-used for anything else) during the time that the pointers to it are expected to be valid to dereference.

Since, as we discussed, Rust can move values without notifying them that they have moved, the first option is ruled out.

In order to implement the second option, we must in some way enforce its key invariant, *i.e.* prevent the value from being *moved* or otherwise invalidated (you may notice this sounds an awful lot like the definition of *pinning* a value). There are a few ways one might be able to enforce this invariant in Rust:

1. Offer a wholly `unsafe` API to interact with the object, thus requiring every caller to uphold the invariant themselves
2. Store the value that must not be moved behind a carefully managed pointer internal to the object
3. Leverage the type system to encode and enforce this invariant by presenting a restricted API surface to interact with *any* object that requires these invariants

The first option is quite obviously undesirable, as the [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe")ty of the interface will become viral throughout all code that interacts with the object.

The second option is a viable solution to the problem for some use cases, in particular for self-referential types. Under this model, any type that has an address sensitive state would ultimately store its data in something like a [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html), carefully manage internal access to that data to ensure no *moves* or other invalidation occurs, and finally provide a safe interface on top.

There are a couple of linked disadvantages to using this model. The most significant is that each individual object must assume it is *on its own* to ensure that its data does not become *moved* or otherwise invalidated. Since there is no shared contract between values of different types, an object cannot assume that others interacting with it will properly respect the invariants around interacting with its data and must therefore protect it from everyone. Because of this, *composition* of address-sensitive types requires at least a level of pointer indirection each time a new object is added to the mix (and, practically, a heap allocation).

Although there were other reasons as well, this issue of expensive composition is the key thing that drove Rust towards adopting a different model. It is particularly a problem when one considers, for example, the implications of composing together the [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future")s which will eventually make up an asynchronous task (including address-sensitive `async fn` state machines). It is plausible that there could be many layers of [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future")s composed together, including multiple layers of `async fn`s handling different parts of a task. It was deemed unacceptable to force indirection and allocation for each layer of composition in this case.

[`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") is an implementation of the third option. It allows us to solve the issues discussed with the second option by building a *shared contractual language* around the guarantees of “pinning” data.

### [§](#using-pinptr-to-pin-values)Using [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") to pin values

In order to pin a value, we wrap a *pointer to that value* (of some type `Ptr`) in a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin"). [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") can wrap any pointer type, forming a promise that the **pointee** will not be *moved* or [otherwise invalidated](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee "mod std::pin").

We call such a [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin")-wrapped pointer a **pinning pointer,** (or pinning reference, or pinning `Box`, etc.) because its existence is the thing that is conceptually pinning the underlying pointee in place: it is the metaphorical “pin” securing the data in place on the pinboard (in memory).

Notice that the thing wrapped by [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") is not the value which we want to pin itself, but rather a pointer to that value! A [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") does not pin the `Ptr`; instead, it pins the pointer’s ***pointee** value*.

#### [§](#pinning-as-a-library-contract)Pinning as a library contract

Pinning does not require nor make use of any compiler “magic”[2](#fn2), only a specific contract between the [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") parts of a library API and its users.

It is important to stress this point as a user of the [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") parts of the [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") API. Practically, this means that performing the mechanics of “pinning” a value by creating a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") to it *does not* actually change the way the compiler behaves towards the inner value! It is possible to use incorrect [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code to create a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") to a value which does not actually satisfy the invariants that a pinned value must satisfy, and in this way lead to undefined behavior even in (from that point) fully safe code. Similarly, using [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe"), one may get access to a bare [`&mut T`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference") from a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") and use that to invalidly *move* the pinned value out. It is the job of the user of the [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") parts of the [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") API to ensure these invariants are not violated.

This differs from e.g. [`UnsafeCell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.UnsafeCell.html "struct std::cell::UnsafeCell") which changes the semantics of a program’s compiled output. A [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") is a handle to a value which we have promised we will not move out of, but Rust still considers all values themselves to be fundamentally moveable through, *e.g.* assignment or [`mem::replace`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.replace.html "fn std::mem::replace").

#### [§](#how-pin-prevents-misuse-in-safe-code)How [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") prevents misuse in safe code

In order to accomplish the goal of pinning the pointee value, [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") restricts access to the wrapped `Ptr` type in safe code. Specifically, [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") disallows the ability to access the wrapped pointer in ways that would allow the user to *move* the underlying pointee value or otherwise re-use that memory for something else without using [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe"). For example, a [`Pin<&mut T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") makes it impossible to obtain the wrapped `&mut T` safely because through that `&mut T` it would be possible to *move* the underlying value out of the pointer with [`mem::replace`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.replace.html "fn std::mem::replace"), etc.

As discussed above, this promise must be upheld manually by [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code which interacts with the [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") so that other [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code can rely on the pointee value being *un-moved* and valid. Interfaces that operate on values which are in an address-sensitive state accept an argument like `Pin<&mut T>` or `Pin<Box<T>>` to indicate this contract to the caller.

[As discussed below](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee "mod std::pin"), opting in to using pinning guarantees in the interface of an address-sensitive type has consequences for the implementation of some safe traits on that type as well.

### [§](#interaction-between-deref-and-pinptr)Interaction between [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html "ops::Deref") and [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin")

Since [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") can wrap any pointer type, it uses [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html "ops::Deref") and [`DerefMut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html "ops::DerefMut") in order to identify the type of the pinned pointee data and provide (restricted) access to it.

A [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") where [`Ptr: Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html "ops::Deref") is a “`Ptr`-style pinning pointer” to a pinned [`Ptr::Target`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html#associatedtype.Target "ops::Deref::Target") – so, a `Pin<Box<T>>` is an owned, pinning pointer to a pinned `T`, and a `Pin<Rc<T>>` is a reference-counted, pinning pointer to a pinned `T`.

[`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") also uses the [`<Ptr as Deref>::Target`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html#associatedtype.Target "ops::Deref::Target") type information to modify the interface it is allowed to provide for interacting with that data (for example, when a pinning pointer points at pinned data which implements [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"), as [discussed below](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#unpin "mod std::pin")).

[`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") requires that implementations of [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html "ops::Deref") and [`DerefMut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html "ops::DerefMut") on `Ptr` return a pointer to the pinned data directly and do not *move* out of the `self` parameter during their implementation of [`DerefMut::deref_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html#tymethod.deref_mut "method std::ops::DerefMut::deref_mut"). It is unsound for [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code to wrap pointer types with such “malicious” implementations of [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html "ops::Deref"); see [`Pin<Ptr>::new_unchecked`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.new_unchecked "associated function std::pin::Pin::new_unchecked") for details.

### [§](#fixing-addrtracker)Fixing `AddrTracker`

The guarantee of a stable address is necessary to make our `AddrTracker` example work. When `check_for_move` sees a `Pin<&mut AddrTracker>`, it can safely assume that value will exist at that same address until said value goes out of scope, and thus multiple calls to it *cannot* panic.

```rust
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::pin::pin;

#[derive(Default)]
struct AddrTracker {
    prev_addr: Option<usize>,
    // remove auto-implemented `Unpin` bound to mark this type as having some
    // address-sensitive state. This is essential for our expected pinning
    // guarantees to work, and is discussed more below.
    _pin: PhantomPinned,
}

impl AddrTracker {
    fn check_for_move(self: Pin<&mut Self>) {
        let current_addr = &*self as *const Self as usize;
        match self.prev_addr {
            None => {
                // SAFETY: we do not move out of self
                let self_data_mut = unsafe { self.get_unchecked_mut() };
                self_data_mut.prev_addr = Some(current_addr);
            },
            Some(prev_addr) => assert_eq!(prev_addr, current_addr),
        }
    }
}

// 1. Create the value, not yet in an address-sensitive state
let tracker = AddrTracker::default();

// 2. Pin the value by putting it behind a pinning pointer, thus putting
// it into an address-sensitive state
let mut ptr_to_pinned_tracker: Pin<&mut AddrTracker> = pin!(tracker);
ptr_to_pinned_tracker.as_mut().check_for_move();

// Trying to access `tracker` or pass `ptr_to_pinned_tracker` to anything that requires
// mutable access to a non-pinned version of it will no longer compile

// 3. We can now assume that the tracker value will never be moved, thus
// this will never panic!
ptr_to_pinned_tracker.as_mut().check_for_move();
```

Note that this invariant is enforced by simply making it impossible to call code that would perform a move on the pinned value. This is the case since the only way to access that pinned value is through the pinning `Pin<&mut T>`, which in turn restricts our access.

### [§](#unpin)[`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin")

The vast majority of Rust types have no address-sensitive states. These types implement the [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") auto-trait, which cancels the restrictive effects of [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") when the *pointee* type `T` is [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"). When [`T: Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"), `Pin<Box<T>>` functions identically to a non-pinning [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html); similarly, `Pin<&mut T>` would impose no additional restrictions above a regular [`&mut T`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference").

The idea of this trait is to alleviate the reduced ergonomics of APIs that require the use of [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") for soundness for some types, but which also want to be used by other types that don’t care about pinning. The prime example of such an API is [`Future::poll`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll "method std::future::Future::poll"). There are many [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future") types that don’t care about pinning. These futures can implement [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") and therefore get around the pinning related restrictions in the API, while still allowing the subset of [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future")s which *do* require pinning to be implemented soundly.

Note that the interaction between a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") and [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") is through the type of the **pointee** value, [`<Ptr as Deref>::Target`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html#associatedtype.Target "ops::Deref::Target"). Whether the `Ptr` type itself implements [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") does not affect the behavior of a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin"). For example, whether or not [`Box`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html "Box") is [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") has no effect on the behavior of `Pin<Box<T>>`, because `T` is the type of the pointee value, not [`Box`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html "Box"). So, whether `T` implements [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") is the thing that will affect the behavior of the `Pin<Box<T>>`.

Builtin types that are [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") include all of the primitive types, like [`bool`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.bool.html "primitive bool"), [`i32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.i32.html "primitive i32"), and [`f32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.f32.html "primitive f32"), references (`&T` and `&mut T`), etc., as well as many core and standard library types like [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html), [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/string/struct.String.html "String"), and more. These types are marked [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") because they do not have an address-sensitive state like the ones we discussed above. If they did have such a state, those parts of their interface would be unsound without being expressed through pinning, and they would then need to not implement [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin").

The compiler is free to take the conservative stance of marking types as [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") so long as all of the types that compose its fields are also [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"). This is because if a type implements [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"), then it is unsound for that type’s implementation to rely on pinning-related guarantees for soundness, *even* when viewed through a “pinning” pointer! It is the responsibility of the implementor of a type that relies upon pinning for soundness to ensure that type is *not* marked as [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") by adding [`PhantomPinned`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/struct.PhantomPinned.html "struct std::marker::PhantomPinned") field. This is exactly what we did with our `AddrTracker` example above. Without doing this, you *must not* rely on pinning-related guarantees to apply to your type!

If you really need to pin a value of a foreign or built-in type that implements [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"), you’ll need to create your own wrapper type around the [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") type you want to pin and then opt-out of [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") using [`PhantomPinned`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/struct.PhantomPinned.html "struct std::marker::PhantomPinned").

Exposing access to the inner field which you want to remain pinned must then be carefully considered as well! Remember, exposing a method that gives access to a `Pin<&mut InnerT>` where `InnerT: Unpin` would allow safe code to trivially move the inner value out of that pinning pointer, which is precisely what you’re seeking to prevent! Exposing a field of a pinned value through a pinning pointer is called “projecting” a pin, and the more general case of deciding in which cases a pin should be able to be projected or not is called “structural pinning.” We will go into more detail about this [below](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#projections-and-structural-pinning "mod std::pin").

## [§](#examples-of-address-sensitive-types)Examples of address-sensitive types

### [§](#a-self-referential-struct)A self-referential struct

Self-referential structs are the simplest kind of address-sensitive type.

It is often useful for a struct to hold a pointer back into itself, which allows the program to efficiently track subsections of the struct. Below, the `slice` field is a pointer into the `data` field, which we could imagine being used to track a sliding window of `data` in parser code.

As mentioned before, this pattern is also used extensively by compiler-generated [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future")s.

```rust
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::marker::PhantomPinned;
use std::ptr::NonNull;

/// This is a self-referential struct because `self.slice` points into `self.data`.
struct Unmovable {
    /// Backing buffer.
    data: [u8; 64],
    /// Points at `self.data` which we know is itself non-null. Raw pointer because we can't do
    /// this with a normal reference.
    slice: NonNull<[u8]>,
    /// Suppress `Unpin` so that this cannot be moved out of a `Pin` once constructed.
    _pin: PhantomPinned,
}

impl Unmovable {
    /// Creates a new `Unmovable`.
    ///
    /// To ensure the data doesn't move we place it on the heap behind a pinning Box.
    /// Note that the data is pinned, but the `Pin<Box<Self>>` which is pinning it can
    /// itself still be moved. This is important because it means we can return the pinning
    /// pointer from the function, which is itself a kind of move!
    fn new() -> Pin<Box<Self>> {
        let res = Unmovable {
            data: [0; 64],
            // We only create the pointer once the data is in place
            // otherwise it will have already moved before we even started.
            slice: NonNull::from(&[]),
            _pin: PhantomPinned,
        };
        // First we put the data in a box, which will be its final resting place
        let mut boxed = Box::new(res);

        // Then we make the slice field point to the proper part of that boxed data.
        // From now on we need to make sure we don't move the boxed data.
        boxed.slice = NonNull::from(&boxed.data);

        // To do that, we pin the data in place by pointing to it with a pinning
        // (`Pin`-wrapped) pointer.
        //
        // `Box::into_pin` makes existing `Box` pin the data in-place without moving it,
        // so we can safely do this now *after* inserting the slice pointer above, but we have
        // to take care that we haven't performed any other semantic moves of `res` in between.
        let pin = Box::into_pin(boxed);

        // Now we can return the pinned (through a pinning Box) data
        pin
    }
}

let unmovable: Pin<Box<Unmovable>> = Unmovable::new();

// The inner pointee `Unmovable` struct will now never be allowed to move.
// Meanwhile, we are free to move the pointer around.
let mut still_unmoved = unmovable;
assert_eq!(still_unmoved.slice, NonNull::from(&still_unmoved.data));

// We cannot mutably dereference a `Pin<Ptr>` unless the pointee is `Unpin` or we use unsafe.
// Since our type doesn't implement `Unpin`, this will fail to compile.
// let mut new_unmoved = Unmovable::new();
// std::mem::swap(&mut *still_unmoved, &mut *new_unmoved);
```

### [§](#an-intrusive-doubly-linked-list)An intrusive, doubly-linked list

In an intrusive doubly-linked list, the collection itself does not own the memory in which each of its elements is stored. Instead, each client is free to allocate space for elements it adds to the list in whichever manner it likes, including on the stack! Elements can live on a stack frame that lives shorter than the collection does provided the elements that live in a given stack frame are removed from the list before going out of scope.

To make such an intrusive data structure work, every element stores pointers to its predecessor and successor within its own data, rather than having the list structure itself managing those pointers. It is in this sense that the structure is “intrusive”: the details of how an element is stored within the larger structure “intrudes” on the implementation of the element type itself!

The full implementation details of such a data structure are outside the scope of this documentation, but we will discuss how [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") can help to do so.

Using such an intrusive pattern, elements may only be added when they are pinned. If we think about the consequences of adding non-pinned values to such a list, this becomes clear:

*Moving* or otherwise invalidating an element’s data would invalidate the pointers back to it which are stored in the elements ahead and behind it. Thus, in order to soundly dereference the pointers stored to the next and previous elements, we must satisfy the guarantee that nothing has invalidated those pointers (which point to data that we do not own).

Moreover, the [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html "trait std::ops::Drop") implementation of each element must in some way notify its predecessor and successor elements that it should be removed from the list before it is fully destroyed, otherwise the pointers back to it would again become invalidated.

Crucially, this means we have to be able to rely on [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") always being called before an element is invalidated. If an element could be deallocated or otherwise invalidated without calling [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop"), the pointers to it stored in its neighboring elements would become invalid, which would break the data structure.

Therefore, pinning data also comes with [the “`Drop` guarantee”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee "mod std::pin").

## [§](#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee)Subtle details and the `Drop` guarantee

The purpose of pinning is not *just* to prevent a value from being *moved*, but more generally to be able to rely on the pinned value *remaining valid **at a specific place*** in memory.

To do so, pinning a value adds an *additional* invariant that must be upheld in order for use of the pinned data to be valid, on top of the ones that must be upheld for a non-pinned value of the same type to be valid:

From the moment a value is pinned by constructing a [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin")ning pointer to it, that value must *remain, **valid***, at that same address in memory, *until its [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") handler is called.*

There is some subtlety to this which we have not yet talked about in detail. The invariant described above means that, yes,

1. The value must not be moved out of its location in memory

but it also implies that,

2. The memory location that stores the value must not get invalidated or otherwise repurposed during the lifespan of the pinned value until its [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") returns or panics

This point is subtle but required for intrusive data structures to be implemented soundly.

### [§](#drop-guarantee)`Drop` guarantee

There needs to be a way for a pinned value to notify any code that is relying on its pinned status that it is about to be destroyed. In this way, the dependent code can remove the pinned value’s address from its data structures or otherwise change its behavior with the knowledge that it can no longer rely on that value existing at the location it was pinned to.

Thus, in any situation where we may want to overwrite a pinned value, that value’s [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") must be called beforehand (unless the pinned value implements [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"), in which case we can ignore all of [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin")’s guarantees, as usual).

The most common storage-reuse situations occur when a value on the stack is destroyed as part of a function return and when heap storage is freed. In both cases, [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") gets run for us by Rust when using standard safe code. However, for manual heap allocations or otherwise custom-allocated storage, [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code must make sure to call [`ptr::drop_in_place`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ptr/fn.drop_in_place.html "fn std::ptr::drop_in_place") before deallocating and re-using said storage.

In addition, storage “re-use”/invalidation can happen even if no storage is (de-)allocated. For example, if we had an [`Option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/option/enum.Option.html "enum std::option::Option") which contained a `Some(v)` where `v` is pinned, then `v` would be invalidated by setting that option to `None`.

Similarly, if a [`Vec`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html "Vec") was used to store pinned values and [`Vec::set_len`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.set_len "Vec::set_len") was used to manually “kill” some elements of a vector, all of the items “killed” would become invalidated, which would be *undefined behavior* if those items were pinned.

Both of these cases are somewhat contrived, but it is crucial to remember that [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin")ned data *must* be [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop")ped before it is invalidated; not just to prevent memory leaks, but as a matter of soundness. As a corollary, the following code can *never* be made safe:

```rust
// Pin something inside a `ManuallyDrop`. This is fine on its own.
let mut pin: Pin<Box<ManuallyDrop<Type>>> = Box::pin(ManuallyDrop::new(Type));

// However, creating a pinning mutable reference to the type *inside*
// the `ManuallyDrop` is not!
let inner: Pin<&mut Type> = unsafe {
    Pin::map_unchecked_mut(pin.as_mut(), |x| &mut **x)
};
```

Because [`mem::ManuallyDrop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/struct.ManuallyDrop.html "struct std::mem::ManuallyDrop") inhibits the destructor of `Type`, it won’t get run when the `Box<ManuallyDrop<Type>>` is dropped, thus violating the drop guarantee of the `Pin<&mut Type>>`.

Of course, *leaking* memory in such a way that its underlying storage will never get invalidated or re-used is still fine: [`mem::forget`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/mem/fn.forget.html "mem::forget")ing a [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) prevents its storage from ever getting re-used, so the [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") guarantee is still satisfied.

## [§](#implementing-an-address-sensitive-type)Implementing an address-sensitive type.

This section goes into detail on important considerations for implementing your own address-sensitive types, which are different from merely using [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") in a generic way.

### [§](#implementing-drop-for-types-with-address-sensitive-states)Implementing [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") for types with address-sensitive states

The [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") function takes [`&mut self`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference"), but this is called *even if that `self` has been pinned*! Implementing [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") for a type with address-sensitive states requires some care, because if `self` was indeed in an address-sensitive state before [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") was called, it is as if the compiler automatically called [`Pin::get_unchecked_mut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.get_unchecked_mut "method std::pin::Pin::get_unchecked_mut").

This can never cause a problem in purely safe code because creating a pinning pointer to a type which has an address-sensitive (thus does not implement `Unpin`) requires `unsafe`, but it is important to note that choosing to take advantage of pinning-related guarantees to justify validity in the implementation of your type has consequences for that type’s [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html "trait std::ops::Drop") implementation as well: if an element of your type could have been pinned, you must treat [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html "trait std::ops::Drop") as implicitly taking `self: Pin<&mut Self>`.

You should implement [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") as follows:

```rust
impl Drop for Type {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        // `new_unchecked` is okay because we know this value is never used
        // again after being dropped.
        inner_drop(unsafe { Pin::new_unchecked(self)});
        fn inner_drop(this: Pin<&mut Type>) {
            // Actual drop code goes here.
        }
    }
}
```

The function `inner_drop` has the signature that [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") *should* have in this situation. This makes sure that you do not accidentally use `self`/`this` in a way that is in conflict with pinning’s invariants.

Moreover, if your type is [`#[repr(packed)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprpacked), the compiler will automatically move fields around to be able to drop them. It might even do that for fields that happen to be sufficiently aligned. As a consequence, you cannot use pinning with a [`#[repr(packed)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprpacked) type.

#### [§](#implementing-drop-for-pointer-types-which-will-be-used-as-pinning-pointers)Implementing [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") for pointer types which will be used as [`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin")ning pointers

It should further be noted that creating a pinning pointer of some type `Ptr` *also* carries with it implications on the way that `Ptr` type must implement [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") (as well as [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html "ops::Deref") and [`DerefMut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html "ops::DerefMut"))! When implementing a pointer type that may be used as a pinning pointer, you must also take the same care described above not to *move* out of or otherwise invalidate the pointee during [`Drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop"), [`Deref`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Deref.html "ops::Deref"), or [`DerefMut`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.DerefMut.html "ops::DerefMut") implementations.

### [§](#assigning-pinned-data)“Assigning” pinned data

Although in general it is not valid to swap data or assign through a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") for the same reason that reusing a pinned object’s memory is invalid, it is possible to do validly when implemented with special care for the needs of the exact data structure which is being modified. For example, the assigning function must know how to update all uses of the pinned address (and any other invariants necessary to satisfy validity for that type). For [`Unmovable`](#a-self-referential-struct) (from the example above), we could write an assignment function like so:

```rust
impl Unmovable {
    // Copies the contents of `src` into `self`, fixing up the self-pointer
    // in the process.
    fn assign(self: Pin<&mut Self>, src: Pin<&mut Self>) {
        unsafe {
            let unpinned_self = Pin::into_inner_unchecked(self);
            let unpinned_src = Pin::into_inner_unchecked(src);
            *unpinned_self = Self {
                data: unpinned_src.data,
                slice: NonNull::from(&mut []),
                _pin: PhantomPinned,
            };

            let data_ptr = unpinned_src.data.as_ptr() as *const u8;
            let slice_ptr = unpinned_src.slice.as_ptr() as *const u8;
            let offset = slice_ptr.offset_from(data_ptr) as usize;
            let len = unpinned_src.slice.as_ptr().len();

            unpinned_self.slice = NonNull::from(&mut unpinned_self.data[offset..offset+len]);
        }
    }
}
```

Even though we can’t have the compiler do the assignment for us, it’s possible to write such specialized functions for types that might need it.

Note that it *is* possible to assign generically through a [`Pin<Ptr>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin") by way of [`Pin::set()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html#method.set "method std::pin::Pin::set"). This does not violate any guarantees, since it will run [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") on the pointee value before assigning the new value. Thus, the [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") implementation still has a chance to perform the necessary notifications to dependent values before the memory location of the original pinned value is overwritten.

### [§](#projections-and-structural-pinning)Projections and Structural Pinning

With ordinary structs, it is natural that we want to add *projection* methods that allow borrowing one or more of the inner fields of a struct when the caller has access to a borrow of the whole struct:

```rust
struct Struct {
    field: Field,
    // ...
}

impl Struct {
    fn field(&mut self) -> &mut Field { &mut self.field }
}
```

When working with address-sensitive types, it’s not obvious what the signature of these functions should be. If `field` takes `self: Pin<&mut Struct>`, should it return [`&mut Field`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference") or `Pin<&mut Field>`? This question also arises with `enum`s and wrapper types like [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html), [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html), and [`RefCell<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html "struct std::cell::RefCell"). (This question applies just as well to shared references, but we’ll examine the more common case of mutable references for illustration)

It turns out that it’s up to the author of `Struct` to decide which type the “projection” should produce. The choice must be *consistent* though: if a pin is projected to a field in one place, then it should very likely not be exposed elsewhere without projecting the pin.

As the author of a data structure, you get to decide for each field whether pinning “propagates” to this field or not. Pinning that propagates is also called “structural”, because it follows the structure of the type.

This choice depends on what guarantees you need from the field for your [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code to work. If the field is itself address-sensitive, or participates in the parent struct’s address sensitivity, it will need to be structurally pinned.

A useful test is if [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code that consumes `Pin<&mut Struct>` also needs to take note of the address of the field itself, it may be evidence that that field is structurally pinned. Unfortunately, there are no hard-and-fast rules.

#### [§](#choosing-pinning-not-to-be-structural-for-field)Choosing pinning *not to be* structural for `field`…

While counter-intuitive, it’s often the easier choice: if you do not expose a `Pin<&mut Field>`, you do not need to be careful about other code moving out of that field, you just have to ensure is that you never create pinning reference to that field. This does of course also mean that if you decide a field does not have structural pinning, you must not write [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe") code that assumes (invalidly) that the field *is* structurally pinned!

Fields without structural pinning may have a projection method that turns `Pin<&mut Struct>` into [`&mut Field`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference"):

```rust
impl Struct {
    fn field(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> &mut Field {
        // This is okay because `field` is never considered pinned, therefore we do not
        // need to uphold any pinning guarantees for this field in particular. Of course,
        // we must not elsewhere assume this field *is* pinned if we choose to expose
        // such a method!
        unsafe { &mut self.get_unchecked_mut().field }
    }
}

You may also in this situation `impl Unpin for Struct {}` *even if* the type of `field` is not [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin"). Since we have explicitly chosen not to care about pinning guarantees for `field`, the way `field`’s type interacts with pinning is no longer relevant in the context of its use in `Struct`.

#### [§](#choosing-pinning-to-be-structural-for-field)Choosing pinning *to be* structural for `field`…

The other option is to decide that pinning is “structural” for `field`, meaning that if the struct is pinned then so is the field.

This allows writing a projection that creates a `Pin<&mut Field>`, thus witnessing that the field is pinned:

```rust
impl Struct {
    fn field(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> Pin<&mut Field> {
        // This is okay because `field` is pinned when `self` is.
        unsafe { self.map_unchecked_mut(|s| &mut s.field) }
    }
}
```

Structural pinning comes with a few extra requirements:

1. *Structural [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin").* A struct can be [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") only if all of its structurally-pinned fields are, too. This is [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin")’s behavior by default. However, as a library author, it is your responsibility not to write something like `impl<T> Unpin for Struct<T> {}` and then offer a method that provides structural pinning to an inner field of `T`, which may not be [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin")! (Adding *any* projection operation requires unsafe code, so the fact that [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") is a safe trait does not break the principle that you only have to worry about any of this if you use [`unsafe`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.unsafe.html "keyword unsafe"))
2. *Pinned Destruction.* As discussed [above](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#implementing-drop-for-types-with-address-sensitive-states "mod std::pin"), [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") takes [`&mut self`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.reference.html "primitive reference"), but the struct (and hence its fields) might have been pinned before. The destructor must be written as if its argument was `self: Pin<&mut Self>`, instead.
   
   As a consequence, the struct *must not* be [`#[repr(packed)]`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/other-reprs.html#reprpacked).
3. *Structural Notice of Destruction.* You must uphold the [`Drop` guarantee](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee "mod std::pin"): once your struct is pinned, the struct’s storage cannot be re-used without calling the structurally-pinned fields’ destructors, as well.
   
   This can be tricky, as witnessed by [`VecDeque<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html): the destructor of [`VecDeque<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html) can fail to call [`drop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop "method std::ops::Drop::drop") on all elements if one of the destructors panics. This violates the [`Drop` guarantee](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/index.html#subtle-details-and-the-drop-guarantee "mod std::pin"), because it can lead to elements being deallocated without their destructor being called.
   
   [`VecDeque<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html) has no pinning projections, so its destructor is sound. If it wanted to provide such structural pinning, its destructor would need to abort the process if any of the destructors panicked.
4. You must not offer any other operations that could lead to data being *moved* out of the structural fields when your type is pinned. For example, if the struct contains an [`Option<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/option/enum.Option.html "enum std::option::Option") and there is a [`take`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.take "method std::option::Option::take")-like operation with type `fn(Pin<&mut Struct<T>>) -> Option<T>`, then that operation can be used to move a `T` out of a pinned `Struct<T>` – which means pinning cannot be structural for the field holding this data.
   
   For a more complex example of moving data out of a pinned type, imagine if [`RefCell<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html "struct std::cell::RefCell") had a method `fn get_pin_mut(self: Pin<&mut Self>) -> Pin<&mut T>`. Then we could do the following:
   
   [ⓘ](# "This example deliberately fails to compile")
   
   ```rust
   fn exploit_ref_cell<T>(mut rc: Pin<&mut RefCell<T>>) {
       // Here we get pinned access to the `T`.
       let _: Pin<&mut T> = rc.as_mut().get_pin_mut();
   
       // And here we have `&mut T` to the same data.
       let shared: &RefCell<T> = rc.into_ref().get_ref();
       let mut borrow = shared.borrow_mut();
       let content = &mut *borrow;
   }
   ```
   
   This is catastrophic: it means we can first pin the content of the [`RefCell<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html "struct std::cell::RefCell") (using `RefCell::get_pin_mut`) and then move that content using the mutable reference we got later.

#### [§](#structural-pinning-examples)Structural Pinning examples

For a type like [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html), both possibilities (structural pinning or not) make sense. A [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) with structural pinning could have `get_pin`/`get_pin_mut` methods to get pinning references to elements. However, it could *not* allow calling [`pop`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.pop "Vec::pop") on a pinned [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) because that would move the (structurally pinned) contents! Nor could it allow [`push`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#method.push "Vec::push"), which might reallocate and thus also move the contents.

A [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) without structural pinning could `impl<T> Unpin for Vec<T>`, because the contents are never pinned and the [`Vec<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) itself is fine with being moved as well. At that point pinning just has no effect on the vector at all.

In the standard library, pointer types generally do not have structural pinning, and thus they do not offer pinning projections. This is why `Box<T>: Unpin` holds for all `T`. It makes sense to do this for pointer types, because moving the [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) does not actually move the `T`: the [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) can be freely movable (aka [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin")) even if the `T` is not. In fact, even `Pin<Box<T>>` and `Pin<&mut T>` are always [`Unpin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html "trait std::marker::Unpin") themselves, for the same reason: their contents (the `T`) are pinned, but the pointers themselves can be moved without moving the pinned data. For both [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) and `Pin<Box<T>>`, whether the content is pinned is entirely independent of whether the pointer is pinned, meaning pinning is *not* structural.

When implementing a [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html "future::Future") combinator, you will usually need structural pinning for the nested futures, as you need to get pinning ([`Pin`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/pin/struct.Pin.html "struct std::pin::Pin")-wrapped) references to them to call [`poll`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll "future::Future::poll"). But if your combinator contains any other data that does not need to be pinned, you can make those fields not structural and hence freely access them with a mutable reference even when you just have `Pin<&mut Self>` (such as in your own [`poll`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/future/trait.Future.html#tymethod.poll "future::Future::poll") implementation).
