# OpenClaw

## What is OpenClaw?

OpenClaw [Github](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw?utm_source=coolify.io) is an AI-powered coding assistant. It supports over 20 AI providers, includes built-in browser automation, and integrates with chat platforms like Telegram, Discord, Slack, and WhatsApp.

::: warning HTTPS Required
OpenClaw requires HTTPS to function correctly. Make sure your deployment is configured with HTTPS enabled.
:::

## Authentication

OpenClaw uses HTTP Basic Auth. The `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables are auto-generated by Coolify during deployment.

A gateway token (`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`) is also generated for API access.

## AI Providers

At least one AI provider API key is required. Set the corresponding environment variable for your provider:

* **Anthropic** — `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
* **OpenAI** — `OPENAI_API_KEY`
* **Google Gemini** — `GEMINI_API_KEY`
* **OpenRouter** — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
* **Groq** — `GROQ_API_KEY`
* **Mistral** — `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
* **xAI** — `XAI_API_KEY`
* **Cerebras** — `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`
* **Amazon Bedrock** — `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
* **Ollama (local)** — `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`

Use `OPENCLAW_PRIMARY_MODEL` to set the default model.

::: tip Model Naming for Proxy Providers
When using a proxy provider like **OpenRouter** or **OpenCode**, you must prefix the model name with the provider path. For example:

* **OpenRouter**: `OPENCLAW_PRIMARY_MODEL=openrouter/google/gemini-2.5-flash`
* **OpenCode**: `OPENCLAW_PRIMARY_MODEL=opencode/google/gemini-2.5-flash`

Using just `google/gemini-2.5-flash` without the provider prefix won't work. Always use the full `provider/model` path.

### Subscription-Based Authentication

If you have an **Anthropic** (Claude) or **OpenAI** (Codex) subscription, you can authenticate using their CLI login flows instead of API keys. Open a terminal in your OpenClaw container and run:

**Anthropic (Claude):**

```bash
openclaw models auth login --provider anthropic
```

**OpenAI (Codex):**

```bash
openclaw models auth login --provider openai
```

Alternatively, use the onboarding wizard to set up authentication interactively:

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

You can verify your authentication status with:

```bash
openclaw models status
```

For the full list of supported providers and configuration options, see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/coollabsio/openclaw?utm_source=coolify.io).

## Browser

The `/browser` endpoint opens a remote browser controlled by OpenClaw via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP). This is useful for OAuth flows, 2FA, captcha solving, and authenticated web scraping.

Browser sessions are persisted across restarts via a dedicated volume. You can configure the browser with these environment variables:

* `BROWSER_DEFAULT_PROFILE` — Browser profile name (default: `openclaw`)
* `BROWSER_SNAPSHOT_MODE` — Snapshot mode (default: `efficient`)
* `BROWSER_EVALUATE_ENABLED` — Enable JavaScript evaluation (default: `true`)
