I'll help you analyze your quarterly sales data with three different visualizations to address each of your questions. Let me create these visualizations for you.

First, let's visualize the hierarchical breakdown of your revenue across product categories:

I've created three comprehensive visualizations to help you understand your quarterly sales data from different perspectives:

#### 1. Hierarchical Revenue Breakdown (Treemap)[​](#1-hierarchical-revenue-breakdown-treemap "Direct link to 1. Hierarchical Revenue Breakdown (Treemap)")

The **treemap visualization** shows your revenue hierarchy with proportional areas representing the relative size of each category and quarter. Key insights:

- **Electronics** is your largest revenue generator ($745k total)
- **Clothing** follows as second largest ($595k total)
- **Home & Garden** is smallest but growing ($410k total)
- You can see how each quarter contributes within each category

#### 2. Performance Metrics Comparison (Radar Chart)[​](#2-performance-metrics-comparison-radar-chart "Direct link to 2. Performance Metrics Comparison (Radar Chart)")

The **radar chart** displays how all three product categories performed across the four quarters, making it easy to compare:

- **Electronics** shows strong Q3 performance ($220k) with slight Q4 decline
- **Clothing** demonstrates consistent growth throughout the year
- **Home & Garden** shows steady upward trajectory across all quarters
- All categories show their strongest performance in Q3-Q4

#### 3. Sales Funnel Flow (Sankey Diagram)[​](#3-sales-funnel-flow-sankey-diagram "Direct link to 3. Sales Funnel Flow (Sankey Diagram)")

The **Sankey diagram** represents customer flow through your sales process, with flow thickness proportional to revenue:

- Shows how market opportunities flow into prospects for each category
- Demonstrates the conversion from prospects to actual sales
- **Electronics** has the thickest flow (highest revenue conversion)
- **Home & Garden** has the thinnest but represents growth opportunity

#### Key Business Insights:[​](#key-business-insights "Direct link to Key Business Insights:")

- **Total Revenue**: $1.75M across all categories
- **Growth Pattern**: All categories show positive growth trends
- **Category Performance**: Electronics (42.6%), Clothing (34%), Home & Garden (23.4%)
- **Seasonal Trends**: Q3 appears to be your strongest quarter overall
