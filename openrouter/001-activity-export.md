Export your aggregated usage data as CSV or PDF from the [Activity page](https://openrouter.ai/activity).

## Overview

The Activity page shows three metrics:

* **Spend**: Total spend (OpenRouter credits + estimated BYOK spend)
* **Tokens**: Total tokens used (prompt + completion)
* **Requests**: Number of AI requests (chatroom included)

Filter by time period (1 Hour, 1 Day, 1 Month, 1 Year) and group by Model, API Key, or Creator (org member). Each time period is sub-grouped by minute, hour, day, and month, respectively.

<Note title="Estimated BYOK Spend">
  Dollars spent for external BYOK usage is estimated based on market rates for that provider, and don't reflect any discounts you might have from them.
</Note>

## How to Export

1. Go to [openrouter.ai/activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity)
2. Select your time period and grouping
3. Open the options dropdown (top right)
4. Choose **Export to...** then **CSV** or **PDF**

![Activity Overview](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/1fdff23f169165c95449be1cf0148f2b9f4d12c22c9c93210c210d2034aa5fd4/content/assets/activity-export-overview.png)

This exports a summary of all three metrics. For detailed breakdowns, click into a specific metric first.

## Detailed Exports

Click any metric card to expand it. From there you can:

* See breakdowns by your selected grouping
* Export the detailed data as CSV or PDF

![Spend by API Key](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/80710434271816ceafb41c0b57a01b37e27fe9d05ab3b5b4285c9a7b6831f6d1/content/assets/activity-export-spend-by-key.png)

For example, a detailed "Tokens by API Key" export to pdf for the last year. It starts with a summary page for all keys, and then granular breakdowns for each key individually:

![PDF Token Report](https://files.buildwithfern.com/openrouter.docs.buildwithfern.com/docs/6ced925f2c31c3c628524d263b24b005a5fe984cc931b92c5581c408fc7f5b13/content/assets/activity-export-pdf-tokens.png)

<Note title="Reasoning Tokens">
  Reasoning tokens are included in completion tokens for billing. This shows how many of the completion tokens were used thinking before responding.
