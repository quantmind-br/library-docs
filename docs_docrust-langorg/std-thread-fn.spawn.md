## Function spawn

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/thread/functions.rs.html#125-132)

```rust
pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>where
    F: FnOnce() -> T + Send + 'static,
    T: Send + 'static,
```

Expand description

Spawns a new thread, returning a [`JoinHandle`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html "struct std::thread::JoinHandle") for it.

The join handle provides a [`join`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join "method std::thread::JoinHandle::join") method that can be used to join the spawned thread. If the spawned thread panics, [`join`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join "method std::thread::JoinHandle::join") will return an [`Err`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/enum.Result.html#variant.Err "variant std::result::Result::Err") containing the argument given to [`panic!`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.panic.html "macro std::panic").

If the join handle is dropped, the spawned thread will implicitly be *detached*. In this case, the spawned thread may no longer be joined. (It is the responsibility of the program to either eventually join threads it creates or detach them; otherwise, a resource leak will result.)

This function creates a thread with the default parameters of [`Builder`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.Builder.html "struct std::thread::Builder"). To specify the new thread’s stack size or the name, use [`Builder::spawn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.Builder.html#method.spawn "method std::thread::Builder::spawn").

As you can see in the signature of `spawn` there are two constraints on both the closure given to `spawn` and its return value, let’s explain them:

- The `'static` constraint means that the closure and its return value must have a lifetime of the whole program execution. The reason for this is that threads can outlive the lifetime they have been created in.
  
  Indeed if the thread, and by extension its return value, can outlive their caller, we need to make sure that they will be valid afterwards, and since we *can’t* know when it will return we need to have them valid as long as possible, that is until the end of the program, hence the `'static` lifetime.
- The [`Send`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html "trait std::marker::Send") constraint is because the closure will need to be passed *by value* from the thread where it is spawned to the new thread. Its return value will need to be passed from the new thread to the thread where it is `join`ed. As a reminder, the [`Send`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Send.html "trait std::marker::Send") marker trait expresses that it is safe to be passed from thread to thread. [`Sync`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Sync.html "trait std::marker::Sync") expresses that it is safe to have a reference be passed from thread to thread.

## [§](#panics)Panics

Panics if the OS fails to create a thread; use [`Builder::spawn`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.Builder.html#method.spawn "method std::thread::Builder::spawn") to recover from such errors.

## [§](#examples)Examples

Creating a thread.

```rust
use std::thread;

let handler = thread::spawn(|| {
    // thread code
});

handler.join().unwrap();
```

As mentioned in the module documentation, threads are usually made to communicate using [`channels`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/index.html "mod std::sync::mpsc"), here is how it usually looks.

This example also shows how to use `move`, in order to give ownership of values to a thread.

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc::channel;

let (tx, rx) = channel();

let sender = thread::spawn(move || {
    tx.send("Hello, thread".to_owned())
        .expect("Unable to send on channel");
});

let receiver = thread::spawn(move || {
    let value = rx.recv().expect("Unable to receive from channel");
    println!("{value}");
});

sender.join().expect("The sender thread has panicked");
receiver.join().expect("The receiver thread has panicked");
```

A thread can also return a value through its [`JoinHandle`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html "struct std::thread::JoinHandle"), you can use this to make asynchronous computations (futures might be more appropriate though).

```rust
use std::thread;

let computation = thread::spawn(|| {
    // Some expensive computation.
    42
});

let result = computation.join().unwrap();
println!("{result}");
```

## [§](#notes)Notes

This function has the same minimal guarantee regarding “foreign” unwinding operations (e.g. an exception thrown from C++ code, or a `panic!` in Rust code compiled or linked with a different runtime) as [`catch_unwind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html); namely, if the thread created with `thread::spawn` unwinds all the way to the root with such an exception, one of two behaviors are possible, and it is unspecified which will occur:

- The process aborts.
- The process does not abort, and [`join`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join "method std::thread::JoinHandle::join") will return a `Result::Err` containing an opaque type.
