In requests to the Web API and responses from it, you will frequently encounter the following parameters:

Spotify URI

The resource identifier of, for example, an artist, album or track. This can be entered in the search box in a Spotify Desktop Client, to navigate to that resource. To find a Spotify URI, right-click (on Windows) or Ctrl-Click (on a Mac) on the artist, album or track name.

Example: `spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6`

Spotify ID

The base-62 identifier found at the end of the Spotify URI (see above) for an artist, track, album, playlist, etc. Unlike a Spotify URI, a Spotify ID does not clearly identify the type of resource; that information is provided elsewhere in the call.

Example: `6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6`

Spotify category ID

The unique string identifying the Spotify category.

Example: `party`

Spotify user ID

The unique string identifying the Spotify user that you can find at the end of the Spotify URI for the user. The ID of the current user can be obtained via the [Get Current User's Profile endpoint](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-current-users-profile).

Example: `wizzler`

Spotify URL

When visited, if the user has the Spotify client installed, it will launch the Client and navigate to the requested resource. Which client is determined by the user's device and account settings at [play.spotify.com](https://play.spotify.com/).

Example: `http://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6`
