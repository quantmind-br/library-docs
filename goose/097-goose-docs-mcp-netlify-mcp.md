2. **Test the game**: Make sure everything works as expected
3. **Share with others**: Your game is now live on the web!

## Future Updates:[​](#future-updates "Direct link to Future Updates:")

Since your code is deployed from your local directory, if you want to make changes:

1. Update your local files
2. Push changes to your GitHub repository
3. You can either:
   
   - Redeploy manually using the same command
   - Set up continuous deployment from GitHub (which would auto-deploy when you push changes)

Would you like me to help you set up continuous deployment from your GitHub repository so that future changes are automatically deployed?

Your tic-tac-toe game is now live and ready to play! 🎮
