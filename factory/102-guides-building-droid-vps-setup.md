## What this doc covers

- Set up Factory’s CLI, Droid, on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) for remote access from anywhere
- Configure SSH authentication with key pairs for secure, passwordless server connections
- Use `droid exec` for headless automation tasks and system administration on your server

* * *

## 1. Prerequisites and installation

Before starting, you’ll need:

- **Factory CLI installed locally** - Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.factory.ai/cli/getting-started/quickstart)
- **Factory account** - Sign up at [factory.ai](https://factory.ai)
- **VPS provider account** - This tutorial uses [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/), but works with any VPS provider (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2, etc.)
- **Basic terminal familiarity** - You’ll be running commands in your local terminal and on the server

**Cost estimate**: A basic VPS suitable for running droid costs around $5-10/month.

## 2. Why use droid on a VPS?

Running AI agents locally limits you to when you’re at your computer. Production debugging, scheduled automation, and mobile access all require a server that’s always available. Without a VPS, you can’t monitor servers from your phone, run headless automation 24/7, or access droid while traveling. By deploying droid on a VPS, you get an always-available AI assistant accessible from any device. Perfect for system administration, production debugging, and building custom automation workflows with `droid exec`.

## 3. Setup and basic usage

Let’s walk through the complete setup process, from creating SSH keys to connecting to your VPS.

### Step 1: Generate SSH keys with droid

We’ll use droid locally to create an SSH key pair. This is more secure than password authentication and enables seamless connections.

```
# Start droid in your local terminal
droid

# Ask droid to create the key pair
> Create a new SSH key pair called example
```

Droid will generate two files:

- `~/.ssh/example` - Private key (keep this secret, never share)
- `~/.ssh/example.pub` - Public key (safe to share, will be added to your VPS)

### Step 2: Copy the public key

```
# Ask droid to copy the public key to your clipboard
> Copy the public key to the clipboard
```

### Step 3: Create your VPS and add the SSH key

In your VPS provider dashboard (Hetzner example):

1. **Create a new server**:
   
   - Choose your server type (e.g., CPX22 - $4.99/month)
   - Select a location (e.g., Ashburn, Virginia)
   - Keep default options
2. **Add your SSH key**:
   
   - In the “SSH Keys” section, click “Add SSH Key”
   - Paste the public key you copied
   - Name it “example” (or any descriptive name)
   - Add the key to the server
3. **Name and create**:
   
   - Optionally name your server (e.g., “example-vps”)
   - Click “Create” and wait for the server to spin up

### Step 4: Configure SSH for easy access

Once your server is ready, copy its IP address (e.g., `123.45.67.89`) and ask droid to configure your SSH settings:

```
# In droid
> Add 123.45.67.89 to my SSH config file with an alias called example so I can connect easily
```

Droid will update your `~/.ssh/config` file to include something like:

```
Host example
    HostName 123.45.67.89
    User root
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/example
```

**What this enables**: Instead of typing `ssh root@123.45.67.89 -i ~/.ssh/example` every time, you can simply run `ssh example`.

### Step 5: Connect and install Droid on the VPS

```
# In a new terminal window, connect to your VPS
ssh example

# Install Factory CLI on the VPS
curl -fsSL https://cli.factory.ai/install.sh | sh

# Activate the installation
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc if using zsh

# Verify installation
droid --version
```

### Step 6: Authenticate Droid on the VPS

```
# Run droid for the first time
droid
```

On first run, droid will prompt you to log in:

1. It displays a URL and an authentication code
2. Copy the code
3. Click the URL (or paste it in your browser)
4. Paste the code to authenticate
5. You’re now logged in and can use droid on your VPS

**Success check**: You should now see the droid prompt on your VPS, ready to accept commands.

## 4. Advanced example: System administration with droid

Now that droid is running on your VPS, let’s use it for practical server administration. This example shows how droid can handle complex setup tasks like configuring a web server.

### Setting up Nginx with Docker

```
# In your VPS, with droid running
> Set up Nginx with Docker and serve a hello world page
```

Droid will:

1. Install Docker if not already present
2. Create a basic Nginx configuration
3. Create an HTML file with “Hello World”
4. Set up and run the Docker container
5. Configure networking and ports

**Verification**: Open a browser and navigate to your VPS IP address (e.g., `http://123.45.67.89`). You should see “Hello World” displayed. **What makes this powerful**: Tasks that normally require multiple commands, configuration files, and troubleshooting are handled by droid with a single natural language instruction. Droid understands best practices and handles edge cases automatically.

## 5. Droid exec: Headless automation and custom agents

The real power of running droid on a VPS is `droid exec` - a headless mode that enables programmatic access for building automation workflows and custom agents.

### What is droid exec?

`droid exec` runs droid commands without an interactive session, making it perfect for:

- Scheduled automation tasks
- Building custom agent frameworks
- Integrating droid into scripts and applications
- Running quick queries from CI/CD pipelines

### Basic droid exec usage

```
# Simple query with a fast model (GLM 4.6)
droid exec --model glm-4.6 "Tell me a joke"
```

### Advanced: System exploration

```
# Ask droid to explore your system and find specific information
droid exec --model glm-4.6 "Explore my system and tell me where the file is that I'm serving with Nginx"
```

Droid will:

1. Search for Nginx configuration files
2. Identify the document root
3. Locate the HTML/content files being served
4. Report back with file paths and relevant configuration

**Output example**:

```
Configuration file: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
Content file: /var/www/html/index.html
Docker setup: /home/user/docker-compose.yml
Server running on: port 80
```

## 6. Remote access from anywhere

One of the biggest advantages of having droid on a VPS is accessing it from any device, including mobile.

### Using Termius for mobile SSH access

[Termius](https://termius.com/) is a modern SSH client available for:

- macOS, Windows, Linux (desktop)
- iOS and Android (mobile)

**Setup steps**:

1. **Install Termius** on your device
2. **Add your SSH key**:
   
   - In Termius, go to Keychain
   - Add a new key
   - Import your private key (`~/.ssh/example`)
3. **Add your VPS host**:
   
   - Create a new host
   - Hostname: Your VPS IP address
   - Username: `root` (or your configured user)
   - Key: Select the key you imported
4. **Connect**: Tap the host to connect

**Mobile workflow**:

```
# On your phone via Termius
ssh example

# Run droid
droid

# Or use droid exec for quick queries
droid exec --model glm-4-flash "Check system resources and uptime"
```

### Real-world scenarios

- **Travel troubleshooting**: Server goes down while you’re away? SSH in from your phone and let droid help diagnose and fix the issue
- **On-call debugging**: Respond to alerts from anywhere with AI-assisted investigation
- **Quick queries**: Check system status, review logs, or make configuration changes without needing your laptop

## Next steps

Now that you have droid running on your VPS:

1. **Explore automation**: Start with simple `droid exec` commands and build up to custom scripts
2. **Set up monitoring**: Use droid to help configure system monitoring and alerting
3. **Create scheduled tasks**: Combine droid exec with cron jobs for recurring automation
4. **Join the community**: Share your use cases and learn from others in the [Factory Discord](https://discord.gg/zuudFXxg69)
