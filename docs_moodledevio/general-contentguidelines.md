The Moodle content guidelines are for UX writers, copywriters, marketers, developers, translators, and anyone else writing for Moodle. By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that we're effective at communicating key messages to our users, and that we maintain consistency across all parts of the Moodle experience.

- If you're writing content for the Moodle interface, such as confirmation messages or error messages, check out the [**Product writing guidelines**](https://moodledev.io/general/category/product-writing-guidelines). They provide recommendations on how to write effective, consistent, and reliable content for Moodle's products.
- The [**Style guide**](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide) is part of the Moodle™ brand guidelines and represents Moodle's values, personality and principles.

If you have feedback on the guidelines or would like to suggest a specific area of content for us to focus on, please join the our [Product writing guidelines discussion](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=451533).
