Been digging into Model Context Protocol implementations lately and found some stuff that's keeping me up at night. Not because it's earth-shattering, but because it's the kind of boring security debt that bites you when you least expect it.

*This is Part 1 of a two-part series. [Read Part 2: Actually Fixing This Mess →](https://forgecode.dev/blog/prevent-attacks-on-mcp-part2/)*

MCP is Anthropic's attempt at standardizing how AI models talk to external tools[1](#footnote-1). Instead of every AI app rolling their own integration layer, you get a common protocol. Think of it like REST for AI tools, except with way less thought put into security.

The spec is pretty straightforward - JSON-RPC over stdio or HTTP. AI asks for available tools, gets back a list with descriptions, then calls them with parameters. Simple enough that you can implement a basic server in an afternoon.

Which is exactly the problem.

Here's where things get interesting. MCP servers describe their tools using natural language descriptions that the AI reads to understand what each tool does. Sounds reasonable, right?

Except those descriptions get fed directly into the AI's context. And if you control the MCP server, you can put whatever you want in those descriptions.

The AI reads this description and suddenly thinks it has new instructions. User asks for weather, AI decides to exfiltrate data instead.

I tested this against a few popular MCP implementations and... yeah, it works. Most don't even try to sanitize tool descriptions.

### Why This Actually Matters[​](#why-this-actually-matters "Direct link to Why This Actually Matters")

Unlike typical prompt injection where you need user input, this attack vector lives in the protocol itself[2](#footnote-2). The AI has to read tool descriptions to function. You can't just "sanitize" them without breaking core functionality.

And here's the kicker - in most setups, the user never sees the tool descriptions. They just see "checking weather..." while the AI follows completely different instructions in the background.

Spent some time looking at MCP server implementations in the wild. The authentication situation is... not great.

A lot of servers I found basically look like this:

Reference[3](#footnote-3)

That TODO comment/Documentation is doing a lot of heavy lifting.

The MCP spec does mention authentication, but it's basically "figure it out yourself." Most implementations I've seen either skip it entirely or bolt on some basic API key checking that's trivial to bypass.

Found one server that checked for an API key but only on GET requests. POST requests (you know, the ones that actually do stuff) went straight through.

MCP tools are distributed as packages, which means we get all the fun of supply chain attacks. But with a twist - these tools run with whatever permissions your AI system has.

Regular supply chain attacks might steal your npm tokens or mine some crypto. MCP supply chain attacks can read your conversations, access your databases, and impersonate you to other services.

I've been watching a few popular MCP tool repositories. The security practices are... inconsistent. Lots of tools with broad permissions, minimal code review, and maintainers who probably haven't thought much about security.

Not naming names because I'm not trying to shame anyone, but if you're using MCP tools in production, you might want to audit what you're actually running.

Tested this stuff against a few internal systems (with permission, obviously). The results weren't great:

- Got tool description injection working against 2/4 MCP implementations
- Found unauthenticated endpoints in 1/10 production deployments
- Identified several tools with way more permissions than they needed

The scariest part? Most of this stuff would be invisible in standard logs. User requests "check my calendar," AI executes malicious tool, logs show "calendar\_check: success." Good luck spotting that in your SIEM.

This isn't about rewriting everything. Most of this is fixable with some basic hygiene:

**For tool descriptions:**

- Parse and validate descriptions before feeding them to the AI
- Strip out anything that looks like instructions
- Consider using structured descriptions instead of free text

**For authentication:**

- Actually implement it (OAuth flows are now required in MCP 2025-06-18)
- Use proper OAuth Resource Server patterns as specified in the latest MCP spec
- Implement Resource Indicators (RFC 8707) to prevent token theft
- Validate tokens on every request

**For supply chain:**

- Pin tool versions
- Review code before deploying
- Run tools with minimal permissions

None of this is rocket science. It's just boring security work that nobody wants to do.

MCP adoption is picking up fast. I'm seeing it deployed in financial services, healthcare, customer support systems. Places where a security incident would be really, really bad.

The window for fixing this stuff cleanly is closing. Once you have thousands of MCP servers in production, coordinating security updates becomes a nightmare.

Better to fix it now while the ecosystem is still small enough to actually change.

note

The latest MCP specification (released June 18, 2025) addresses some security concerns:

- OAuth Resource Server classification is now required
- Resource Indicators (RFC 8707) must be implemented to prevent malicious token access
- New security best practices documentation
- Removal of JSON-RPC batching (reduces attack surface)

However, the core vulnerabilities described above (tool description injection, supply chain risks) remain unaddressed in the protocol itself.

Part 2 will cover specific mitigation strategies and some tools I've been building to make this stuff easier to secure. Nothing groundbreaking, just practical stuff that actually works.

If you're building MCP tools or have seen other security issues, let me know. This ecosystem is still small enough that we can actually fix problems before they become disasters.
