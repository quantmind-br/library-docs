APIs for developers writing applications that run in Ghostty.

Programs running in terminals use **control sequences** to interact with the terminal. Control sequences are a series of special characters that the terminal interprets as commands. These are sometimes referred to as **VT sequences** or **escape codes**.

For a full list of supported sequences, see the [reference](https://ghostty.org/docs/vt/reference). For a conceptual overview of control sequences, see the [concepts page](https://ghostty.org/docs/vt/concepts/sequences). The current page will give an overview of Ghostty's control sequence support.
