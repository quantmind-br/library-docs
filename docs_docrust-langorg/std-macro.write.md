## Macro write

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/macros/mod.rs.html#606)

```rust
macro_rules! write {
    ($dst:expr, $($arg:tt)*) => { ... };
    ($($arg:tt)*) => { ... };
}
```

Expand description

Writes formatted data into a buffer.

This macro accepts a ‘writer’, a format string, and a list of arguments. Arguments will be formatted according to the specified format string and the result will be passed to the writer. The writer may be any value with a `write_fmt` method; generally this comes from an implementation of either the [`fmt::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/trait.Write.html "trait std::fmt::Write") or the [`io::Write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Write.html) trait. The macro returns whatever the `write_fmt` method returns; commonly a [`fmt::Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/type.Result.html "type std::fmt::Result"), or an [`io::Result`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/type.Result.html).

See [`std::fmt`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/index.html) for more information on the format string syntax.

## [§](#examples)Examples

```rust
use std::io::Write;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut w = Vec::new();
    write!(&mut w, "test")?;
    write!(&mut w, "formatted {}", "arguments")?;

    assert_eq!(w, b"testformatted arguments");
    Ok(())
}
```

A module can import both `std::fmt::Write` and `std::io::Write` and call `write!` on objects implementing either, as objects do not typically implement both. However, the module must avoid conflict between the trait names, such as by importing them as `_` or otherwise renaming them:

```rust
use std::fmt::Write as _;
use std::io::Write as _;

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut s = String::new();
    let mut v = Vec::new();

    write!(&mut s, "{} {}", "abc", 123)?; // uses fmt::Write::write_fmt
    write!(&mut v, "s = {:?}", s)?; // uses io::Write::write_fmt
    assert_eq!(v, b"s = \"abc 123\"");
    Ok(())
}
```

If you also need the trait names themselves, such as to implement one or both on your types, import the containing module and then name them with a prefix:

```rust
use std::fmt::{self, Write as _};
use std::io::{self, Write as _};

struct Example;

impl fmt::Write for Example {
    fn write_str(&mut self, _s: &str) -> core::fmt::Result {
         unimplemented!();
    }
}
```

Note: This macro can be used in `no_std` setups as well. In a `no_std` setup you are responsible for the implementation details of the components.

```rust
use core::fmt::Write;

struct Example;

impl Write for Example {
    fn write_str(&mut self, _s: &str) -> core::fmt::Result {
         unimplemented!();
    }
}

let mut m = Example{};
write!(&mut m, "Hello World").expect("Not written");
```
