## Intro

We built this changelog to maintain transparency with you—our users and community. It documents our journey to create a more intelligent, helpful coding companion for your daily work. While we ship improvements weekly, we compile these updates into monthly changelog entries to provide an organized overview. This approach gives you a clear record of our progress while making it easier to track significant developments in our continuous delivery cycle.
