A Docker image digest is a unique, cryptographic identifier (SHA-256 hash) representing the content of a Docker image. Unlike tags, which can be reused or changed, a digest is immutable and ensures that the exact same image is pulled every time. This guarantees consistency across different environments and deployments.

For example, the digest for the `nginx:latest` image might look like:

This digest uniquely identifies the specific version of the `nginx:latest` image, ensuring that any changes to the image content result in a different digest.

Using image digests instead of tags offers several advantages:

- Immutability: Once an image is built and its digest is generated, the content tied to that digest cannot change. This means that if you pull an image using its digest, you can be confident that you are retrieving exactly the same image that was originally built.
- Security: Digests help prevent supply chain attacks by ensuring that the image content has not been tampered with. Even a small change in the image content will result in a completely different digest.
- Consistency: Using digests ensures that the same image is used across different environments, reducing the risk of discrepancies between development, staging, and production environments.

By using image digests to reference DHIs, you can ensure that your applications are always using the exact same secure image version, enhancing security and compliance

### [Use the Docker CLI](#use-the-docker-cli)

To view the image digest of a Docker image, you can use the following command. Replace `<image-name>:<tag>` with the image name and tag.

### [Use the Docker Hub UI](#use-the-docker-hub-ui)

1. Go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and sign in.
2. Navigate to your organization's namespace and open the mirrored DHI repository.
3. Select the **Tags** tab to view image variants.
4. Each tag in the list includes a **Digest** field showing the image's SHA-256 value.

Pulling an image by digest ensures that you are pulling the exact image version identified by the specified digest.

To pull a Docker image using its digest, use the following command. Replace `<image-name>` with the image name and `<digest>` with the image digest.

For example, to pull a `docs/dhi-python:3.13` image using its digest of `94a00394bc5a8ef503fb59db0a7d0ae9e1110866e8aee8ba40cd864cea69ea1a`, you would run:

Docker Hardened Images are published as multi-platform images, which means a single image tag (like `docs/dhi-python:3.13`) can support multiple operating systems and CPU architectures, such as `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, and more.

Instead of pointing to a single image, a multi-platform tag points to a manifest list (also called an index), which is a higher-level object that references multiple image digests, one for each supported platform.

When you inspect a multi-platform image using `docker buildx imagetools inspect`, you'll see something like this:

- The manifest list digest (`sha256:6e05...d231`) identifies the overall multi-platform image.
- Each platform-specific image has its own digest (e.g., `sha256:94a0...ea1a` for `linux/amd64`).

### [Why this matters](#why-this-matters)

- Reproducibility: If you're building or running containers on different architectures, using a tag alone will resolve to the appropriate image digest for your platform.
- Verification: You can pull and verify a specific image digest for your platform to ensure you're using the exact image version, not just the manifest list.
- Policy enforcement: When enforcing digest-based policies with Docker Scout, each platform variant is evaluated individually using its digest.
