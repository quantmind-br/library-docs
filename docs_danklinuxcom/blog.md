## DMS 1.0

The Dark Knight

We're excited to announce DankMaterialShell (DMS) 1.0! ~ DMS is a Desktop Shell for Wayland Compositors built with [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org/) & GO.

What started as a small hobby project has grown into a full desktop shell and application suite with thousands of users and dozens of contributors - with first class support for [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri), [Hyprland](https://hypr.land), [Sway](https://swaywm.org), [MangoWC](https://mangowc.vercel.app/), and [LabWC](https://labwc.github.io/). As well as general support for all compositors implementing select wayland protocols.
