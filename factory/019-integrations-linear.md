This guide will walk you through the process of integrating Factory with Linear, enabling seamless interaction between Factory and your Linear projects.

## Prerequisites

- Admin access to your Linear workspace
- A Factory account with admin privileges

## Integration Steps

## Verification

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Create a test issue in one of the authorized Linear projects.
2. Use Factory to interact with this issue (e.g., comment on it or change its status).
3. Verify that the changes are reflected in Linear.

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Factory.
- Use Linear’s team-level settings to manage access efficiently.
- Keep your Linear workspace’s security settings up-to-date.
