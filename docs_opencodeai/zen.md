Zen gives you access to a curated set of AI models that OpenCode has tested and benchmarked specifically for coding agents. No need to worry about inconsistent performance and quality, use validated models that work.

[Get started with Zen](https://opencode.ai/auth)

**Add $20 Pay as you go balance** (+$1.23 card processing fee)

Use with any agent. Set monthly spend limits. Cancel any time.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

### What problem is Zen solving?

There are so many models available, but only a few work well with coding agents. Most providers configure them differently with varying results.

We're fixing this for everyone, not just OpenCode users.

- \[\*] Testing select models and consulting their teams
- \[\*] Working with providers to ensure they’re delivered properly
- \[\*] Benchmarking all model-provider combinations we recommend

### How Zen works

While we suggest you use Zen with OpenCode, you can use Zen with any agent.

- \[1]
- \[2]
  
  **Use Zen with transparent pricing** - [pay per request](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/#pricing) with zero markups
- \[3]
  
  **Auto-top up** - when your balance reaches $5 we’ll automatically add $20

### Your privacy is important to us

\[\*]

All Zen models are hosted in the US. Providers follow a zero-retention policy and do not use your data for model training, with the [following exceptions](https://opencode.ai/docs/zen/#privacy).
