            The quality of the generated image. `glm-image` default is `hd`,

            image with higher overall consistency, but takes about `20` seconds.
            `standard`: Generates an image quickly, suitable for scenarios with
            higher requirements for generation speed, takes about `5-10`
            seconds.
