summary: This document outlines the operational limits and quotas for Cloudflare Queues, including message size, throughput, retention periods, and consumer execution constraints. It also provides instructions for requesting limit increases and configuring CPU time for consumer Workers.

| Feature | Limit |
| - | - |
| Queues | 10,000 per account |
| Message size | 128 KB 1 |
| Message retries | 100 |
| Maximum consumer batch size | 100 messages |
| Maximum messages per `sendBatch` call | 100 (or 256KB in total) |
| Maximum Batch wait time | 60 seconds |
| Per-queue message throughput | 5,000 messages per second 2 |
| Message retention period 3 | 4 days (default). [Configurable to 14 days](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/configure-queues/#queue-configuration) |
| Per-queue backlog size 4 | 25GB |
| Concurrent consumer invocations | 250 push-based only |
| Consumer duration (wall clock time) | 15 minutes 5 |
| [Consumer CPU time](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time) | 30 seconds (default). [Configurable to 5 minutes](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/platform/limits/#increasing-queue-consumer-worker-cpu-limits) |
| `visibilityTimeout` (pull-based queues) | 12 hours |
| `delaySeconds` (when sending or retrying) | 12 hours |
| Requests to the Queues API (excluding pull consumer operations)6 | [1200 requests / 5 mins](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/reference/limits/) |

1 1 KB is measured as 1000 bytes. Messages can include up to \~100 bytes of internal metadata that counts towards total message limits.

2 Exceeding the maximum message throughput will cause the `send()` and `sendBatch()` methods to throw an exception with a `Too Many Requests` error until your producer falls below the limit.

3 Messages in a queue that reach the maximum message retention are deleted from the queue. Queues does not delete messages in the same queue that have not reached this limit.

4 Individual queues that reach this limit will receive a `Storage Limit Exceeded` error when calling `send()` or `sendBatch()` on the queue.

5 Refer to [Workers limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#cpu-time).

6 [Pull Consumers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/pull-consumers) allow you to consume messages from a queue over HTTP. Pulls, acknowledgements, and retries over HTTP are not subject to the API rate limit.

Need a higher limit?

To request an adjustment to a limit, complete the [Limit Increase Request Form](https://forms.gle/ukpeZVLWLnKeixDu7). If the limit can be increased, Cloudflare will contact you with next steps.

### Increasing Queue Consumer Worker CPU Limits

[Queue consumer Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/reference/how-queues-works/#consumers) are Worker scripts, and share the same [per invocation CPU limits](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-limits) as any Workers do. Note that CPU time is active processing time: not time spent waiting on network requests, storage calls, or other general I/O.

By default, the maximum CPU time per consumer Worker invocation is set to 30 seconds, but can be increased by setting `limits.cpu_ms` in your Wrangler configuration:

* wrangler.jsonc

  ```jsonc
  {
    // ...rest of your configuration...
    "limits": {
      "cpu_ms": 300000, // 300,000 milliseconds = 5 minutes
    },
    // ...rest of your configuration...
  }
  ```

* wrangler.toml

  ```toml
  [limits]
  cpu_ms = 300_000
  ```
