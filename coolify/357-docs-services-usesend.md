# Usesend

## What is Usesend

Usesend is an open-source alternative to Resend, Sendgrid, Mailgun and Postmark etc. Previously known as unsend.

There are some setup to be made, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.usesend.com/self-hosting/overview?utm_source=coolify.io) for more information.

## SMTP Configuration

Running Usesend with SMTP support requires an additional relay component to handle incoming SMTP requests. This relay service binds to multiple ports supporting both SSL and TLS connections.

### Prerequisites

Before configuring the SMTP relay, you need to add a certificate dumper to your Traefik proxy configuration to make Coolify's SSL certificates accessible to the relay:

1. Navigate to **Server** → **Proxy** → **Configuration**
2. Add the following certificate dumper configuration:

```yaml
traefik-certs-dumper:
  image: ghcr.io/kereis/traefik-certs-dumper:latest
  container_name: traefik-certs-dumper
  restart: unless-stopped
  depends_on:
    - traefik
  volumes:
    - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    - /data/coolify/proxy:/traefik:ro
    - /data/coolify/certs:/output
```

This service extracts Traefik-managed certificates and outputs them to `/data/coolify/certs/`, making them available for the SMTP relay to use for SSL and TLS connections.

### Adding the SMTP Relay Service

Add the following service at the end of the compose file (by clicking on "Edit compose file" when adding the service):

:::info
Replace `###USESEND FQDN (e.g. usesend.example.com)###` with your unsend domain name in the configuration below.
:::

```yaml
  smtp-server:
    container_name: usesend-smtp-server
    image: 'usesend/smtp-proxy:latest'
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: /data/coolify/certs/###USESEND FQDN (e.g. usesend.example.com)###/key.pem
        target: /data/certs/key.pem
        read_only: true
      - type: bind
        source: /data/coolify/certs/###USESEND FQDN (e.g. usesend.example.com)###/cert.pem
        target: /data/certs/cert.pem
        read_only: true
    environment:
      - SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME=usesend
      - SERVICE_FQDN_SMTP
      - 'USESEND_BASE_URL=${SERVICE_URL_USESEND_3000}'
      - USESEND_API_KEY_PATH=/data/certs/key.pem
      - USESEND_API_CERT_PATH=/data/certs/cert.pem
    ports:
      - '25:25'
      - '587:587'
      - '2587:2587'
      - '465:465'
      - '2465:2465'
    healthcheck:
      test:
        - CMD
        - nc
        - -z
        - localhost
        - "25"
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
```

Then add those environment variables to the main Usesend service:

```yaml
      - SMTP_HOST=${SERVICE_FQDN_SMTP}
      - SMTP_USER=${SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME}
```

### Using Usesend SMTP in Your Applications

Once the relay is deployed, configure your sending applications with the following settings:

* **SMTP Host**: Your Usesend URL
* **SMTP Port**: 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS/STARTTLS)
* **Username**: `usesend`
* **Password**: Your Usesend API key (generated from the Usesend dashboard)

The relay supports multiple ports for compatibility with different applications:

* **Standard SMTP**: Ports 25, 587, 2587
* **SSL/TLS**: Ports 465, 2465

You can verify that emails are being sent successfully through Usesend's deliverability reports and message previews in the dashboard.
