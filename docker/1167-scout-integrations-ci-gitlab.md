## Integrate Docker Scout with GitLab CI/CD

Table of contents

* * *

The following examples runs in GitLab CI in a repository containing a Docker image's definition and contents. Triggered by a commit, the pipeline builds the image. If the commit was to the default branch, it uses Docker Scout to get a CVE report. If the commit was to a different branch, it uses Docker Scout to compare the new version to the current published version.

## [Steps](#steps)

First, set up the rest of the workflow. There's a lot that's not specific to Docker Scout but needed to create the images to compare.

Add the following to a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file at the root of your repository.

```
docker-build:image:docker:lateststage:buildservices:- docker:dindbefore_script:- docker login -u "$CI_REGISTRY_USER" -p "$CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD" $CI_REGISTRY# Install curl and the Docker Scout CLI- |      apk add --update curl
      curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/scout-cli/main/install.sh | sh -s -- 
      apk del curl 
      rm -rf /var/cache/apk/*# Login to Docker Hub required for Docker Scout CLI- echo "$DOCKER_HUB_PAT" | docker login -u "$DOCKER_HUB_USER" --password-stdin
```

This sets up the workflow to build Docker images with Docker-in-Docker mode, running Docker inside a container.

It then downloads `curl` and the Docker Scout CLI plugin, logs into the Docker registry using environment variables defined in your repository's settings.

Add the following to the YAML file:

```
script:- |    if [[ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" == "$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH" ]]; then
      tag=""
      echo "Running on default branch '$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH': tag = 'latest'"
    else
      tag=":$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
      echo "Running on branch '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH': tag = $tag"
    fi- docker build --pull -t "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE${tag}" .- |    if [[ "$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH" == "$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH" ]]; then
      # Get a CVE report for the built image and fail the pipeline when critical or high CVEs are detected
      docker scout cves "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE${tag}" --exit-code --only-severity critical,high    
    else
      # Compare image from branch with latest image from the default branch and fail if new critical or high CVEs are detected
      docker scout compare "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE${tag}" --to "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:latest" --exit-code --only-severity critical,high --ignore-unchanged
    fi- docker push "$CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE${tag}"
```

This creates the flow mentioned previously. If the commit was to the default branch, Docker Scout generates a CVE report. If the commit was to a different branch, Docker Scout compares the new version to the current published version. It only shows critical or high-severity vulnerabilities and ignores vulnerabilities that haven't changed since the last analysis.

Add the following to the YAML file:

```
rules:- if:$CI_COMMIT_BRANCHexists:- Dockerfile
```

These final lines ensure that the pipeline only runs if the commit contains a Dockerfile and if the commit was to the CI branch.
