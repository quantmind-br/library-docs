## [Course Custom fields](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/plugintypes/customfield)

Course custom fields allow you to create field types to be used for course custom fields. Instances of these field types can be added to a course. for example, if you want to display radio buttons on the course edit page, then you can create a radio custom course field plugin.

## [Groups API](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.1/apis/subsystems/group)

Moodle Groups are a way of expressing collections of users within a course. They may be defined by the teacher in the course participants page, or created automatically during a bulk user upload (for example, from a text file).
