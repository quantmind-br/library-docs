Zencoder is committed to safeguarding your code, prompts, and results. Our approach combines privacy-by-design with defense‑in‑depth security practices. We encrypt data in transit and at rest, minimize the data we collect, and logically isolate customer workspaces to reduce risk. Enterprise-grade controls—such as SSO/SCIM, role‑based access, audit logging, and configurable retention—help organizations align Zencoder with their internal security programs. Internally, we apply least‑privilege access, secure SDLC practices, and formal change management to maintain a high security bar. We routinely evaluate our controls against industry standards and publish updates in our Trust Center. If you require regional processing, custom terms, or enhanced governance, our team can support those needs through enterprise plans. The FAQs below summarize how we protect your information and uphold responsible AI practices.
