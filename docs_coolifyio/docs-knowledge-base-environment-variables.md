# Environment Variables

You can define environment variables for your resources, and they will be available in your application.

> Preview Deployments could have different environment variables, so you can test your application as a staging environment for example.

## Build Time Variables

If you would like to set environment variables for the build process, you can do it by setting the checkbox `Build Variable` in the normal view on the UI.

## Shared Variables

You could have 3 types of shared variables:

1. Team Based
2. Project Based
3. Environment Based (production, staging, etc.)

You can set shared variables on their respective pages.

Then you can use these variables anywhere. For example: You defined `NODE_ENV` to `production`.

### Team Based

You can set them on the `Team` page and use it with {{team.NODE\_ENV}}. Do not replace "team" with your actual team name.

### Project Based

You can set them on the `Projects` page, under the gear icon and use it with {{project.NODE\_ENV}}. Do not replace "project" with your actual project name.

### Environment Based

You can set them on the `Environments` page (select a `Project`), under the gear icon and use it with {{environment.NODE\_ENV}} Do not replace "environment" with your actual environment name.

### Using Environment and Shared Variables in Docker Compose

Within Coolify you can configure these easily following the details found in the [Knowledge Base for Docker Compose](/knowledge-base/docker/compose#shared-environment-variables).

## Predefined Variables

Coolify predefines some variables for you, so you can use them in your application or service. All you need to do is to add an environment variable like this to your application or service.

```bash
# For example, you can use this variable in your application
MY_VARIABLE=$SOURCE_COMMIT
# You will have the commit hash of the source code in your application as an environment variable in MY_VARIABLE
```

### Application Variables

#### `COOLIFY_FQDN`

Fully qualified domain name(s) of the application.

#### `COOLIFY_URL`

URL(s) of the application.

#### `COOLIFY_BRANCH`

Branch name of the source code.

#### `COOLIFY_RESOURCE_UUID`

Unique resource identifier generated by Coolify.

#### `COOLIFY_CONTAINER_NAME`

Name of the container generated by Coolify.

#### `SOURCE_COMMIT`

Commit hash of the source code.

::: tip Build Cache
By default, `SOURCE_COMMIT` is not included in Docker builds to preserve cache. Enable "Include Source Commit in Build" in your application's General settings if your build process needs this value.
:::

#### `PORT`

If not set: it is set to the `Port Exposes`'s first port.

#### `HOST`

If not set: it is set to `0.0.0.0`

### Service Stack Variables

#### `SERVICE_NAME_<SERVICE>`

The service name of a given service in the stack. For example, if you have a service named `web`, you can access it with `SERVICE_NAME_WEB`. Useful for preview deployments where service names will vary.
