DSPy is a machine learning framework, so working in it involves training sets, development sets, and test sets. For each example in your data, we distinguish typically between three types of values: the inputs, the intermediate labels, and the final label. You can use DSPy effectively without any intermediate or final labels, but you will need at least a few example inputs.

## DSPy `Example` objects[¶](#dspy-example-objects "Permanent link")

The core data type for data in DSPy is `Example`. You will use **Examples** to represent items in your training set and test set.

DSPy **Examples** are similar to Python `dict`s but have a few useful utilities. Your DSPy modules will return values of the type `Prediction`, which is a special sub-class of `Example`.

When you use DSPy, you will do a lot of evaluation and optimization runs. Your individual datapoints will be of type `Example`:

```
qa_pair = dspy.Example(question="This is a question?", answer="This is an answer.")

print(qa_pair)
print(qa_pair.question)
print(qa_pair.answer)
```

**Output:**

```
Example({'question': 'This is a question?', 'answer': 'This is an answer.'}) (input_keys=None)
This is a question?
This is an answer.
```

Examples can have any field keys and any value types, though usually values are strings.

```
object = Example(field1=value1, field2=value2, field3=value3, ...)
```

You can now express your training set for example as:

```
trainset = [dspy.Example(report="LONG REPORT 1", summary="short summary 1"), ...]
```

### Specifying Input Keys[¶](#specifying-input-keys "Permanent link")

In traditional ML, there are separated "inputs" and "labels".

In DSPy, the `Example` objects have a `with_inputs()` method, which can mark specific fields as inputs. (The rest are just metadata or labels.)

```
# Single Input.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question"))

# Multiple Inputs; be careful about marking your labels as inputs unless you mean it.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question", "answer"))
```

Values can be accessed using the `.`(dot) operator. You can access the value of key `name` in defined object `Example(name="John Doe", job="sleep")` through `object.name`.

To access or exclude certain keys, use `inputs()` and `labels()` methods to return new Example objects containing only input or non-input keys, respectively.

```
article_summary = dspy.Example(article= "This is an article.", summary= "This is a summary.").with_inputs("article")

input_key_only = article_summary.inputs()
non_input_key_only = article_summary.labels()

print("Example object with Input fields only:", input_key_only)
print("Example object with Non-Input fields only:", non_input_key_only)
```

**Output**

```
Example object with Input fields only: Example({'article': 'This is an article.'}) (input_keys={'article'})
Example object with Non-Input fields only: Example({'summary': 'This is a summary.'}) (input_keys=None)
```
