Enterprise adoption requires more than a good developer experience—you need to understand **who is using Droid, on what, and at what cost**. Factory is built around **OpenTelemetry (OTEL)** so you can plug Droid directly into your existing observability stack, with optional cloud analytics for organizations that want a hosted view.

## OTEL‑native metrics and traces

Droid emits OTEL signals that capture how it is used across your org.

### Key metric families

Examples of metric categories include:

- **Session metrics**
  
  - Counts of interactive and headless sessions.
  - Session duration and active engagement time.
- **LLM usage metrics**
  
  - Tokens in/out per model and provider.
  - Request counts and latencies.
  - Error rates and retry behavior.
- **Tool usage metrics**
  
  - Tool invocations and execution time.
  - Success/failure rates.
  - Command risk levels proposed and executed.
- **Code modification metrics**
  
  - Files and lines modified, created, or deleted.
  - Distribution across repositories and teams.

### Traces and spans

Traces can show the lifecycle of a session or automation run:

- Session start → prompt construction → LLM call → tool execution → code edits → validation.
- Spans capture timing and metadata for each step, including model choice, tools invoked, and error conditions.

These signals allow you to build dashboards in systems like **Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, or Splunk** without depending on a proprietary analytics service. For a deeper look at the telemetry schema and how it supports compliance and audits, see [Compliance, Audit & Monitoring](https://docs.factory.ai/enterprise/compliance-audit-and-monitoring).

## Factory cloud analytics (optional)

In cloud‑managed deployments, Factory can provide a **hosted analytics view** for platform and leadership teams. Typical views include:

- Adoption metrics by org, team, and repository.
- Model usage and performance trends.
- High‑level cost estimates for LLM usage.
- Top workflows and droids by frequency.

These dashboards are built on top of the same signals Droid emits via OTEL; enabling them does not change the underlying telemetry model. Hybrid and fully airgapped deployments commonly rely solely on **customer‑owned OTEL pipelines** and disable hosted analytics entirely.

## Cost management strategies

LLM cost control is a combination of **model policy**, **usage patterns**, and **observability**. Recommended practices:

## Measuring productivity impact

Cost only matters in the context of outcomes. With OTEL, you can correlate Droid usage with **software delivery and quality metrics** you already track. Common approaches:

- Link OTEL traces for Droid sessions with CI builds, test runs, and deployment pipelines.
- Measure how often Droid is involved in changes that reduce incidents, resolve alerts, or improve test coverage.
- Use code modification metrics to estimate automation impact (for example, lines of code refactored or migrated).

These analyses are done entirely in your existing observability and analytics stack; Factory’s role is to provide clean, structured signals from Droid.
