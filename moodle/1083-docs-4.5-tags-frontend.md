## [Combobox searching](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/guides/javascript/comboboxsearch)

A combobox search component has been added to the core Moodle system. This component provides an additional layer of search functionality, allowing users to easily navigate and filter search results. The combobox search component is designed to be reusable and can be integrated into various areas of the Moodle platform.

## [Creating a reactive UI](https://moodledev.io/docs/4.5/guides/javascript/reactive)

Third-party plugin developers are free to use any framework they want to implement reactive interfaces like React, Angular or Vue. However, for now Moodle does not provide any of them and all core developments are framework independent.
