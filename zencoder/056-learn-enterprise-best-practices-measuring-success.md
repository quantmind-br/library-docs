Why is AI coding adoption a challenge? Why wouldn’t everyone use it?

Adoption bumps into muscle memory. Senior engineers in particular have honed reliable habits and are wary of anything that might add risk, so even a tool that promises speed gains can feel like disruption. You have to acknowledge that tension and frame AI as a way to reinforce their expertise, not erase it.

What is a pilot program in the context of AI coding adoption?

A good pilot limits access to a small, motivated cohort first. You train far fewer people at once, gather real-world examples quickly, and then let those early adopters mentor their teammates during rollout. Their credibility and playbooks create a multiplier effect that a broad, cold start could never match.

What type of training can aid AI coding adoption?

Sequence training so people can build confidence: start with autocomplete basics, then walk through full agent sessions, then highlight curated custom agents that solve company-specific tasks, and finally coach advanced users on creating their own agents. Each rung lowers the friction of changing habits and keeps the next capability feeling like a natural extension instead of a jump.

What are some possible pitfalls when trying to adopt AI?

Pitfalls mirror the guidance above: forcing every engineer onto AI on day one, rewarding only vanity metrics like AI LoC, or issuing a top-down command without room for experimentation. Position it as an opt-in accelerator, celebrate the teams that prove out meaningful wins, and use their experience to help others ramp at their own pace.
