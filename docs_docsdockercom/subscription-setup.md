Docker subscriptions provide features and benefits for individual developers, teams, and enterprise businesses. This page explains how to set up subscriptions for personal accounts and organizations.

Before you begin, make sure you have a [Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/). To learn more about what's included with each tier, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/).

For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

When you [create your Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/), you automatically get a Docker Personal subscription. This subscription includes essential Docker tools at no cost. If you want to continue with Docker Personal, no further action is needed. You can start using Docker Desktop, Docker Hub, and other tools immediately.

If you need additional features like Docker Build Cloud minutes and more Docker Scout repositories, see [Upgrade your subscription](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/change/#upgrade-your-subscription).

You can subscribe a new or existing organization to Docker Team or Business subscriptions. Only organization owners can manage billing for the organization.
