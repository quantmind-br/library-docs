## FAQs on Docker accounts

Table of contents

* * *

### [What is a Docker ID?](#what-is-a-docker-id)

A Docker ID is a username for your Docker account that lets you access Docker products. To create a Docker ID you need one of the following:

- An email address
- A social account
- A GitHub account

Your Docker ID must be between 4 and 30 characters long, and can only contain numbers and lowercase letters. You can't use any special characters or spaces.

For more information, see [Create a Docker ID](https://docs.docker.com/accounts/create-account/).

### [Can I change my Docker ID?](#can-i-change-my-docker-id)

No. You can't change your Docker ID once it's created. If you need a different Docker ID, you must create a new Docker account with a new Docker ID.

Docker IDs can't be reused after deactivation.

### [What if my Docker ID is taken?](#what-if-my-docker-id-is-taken)

All Docker IDs are first-come, first-served except for companies that have a U.S. Trademark on a username.

If you have a trademark for your namespace, [Docker Support](https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/) can retrieve the Docker ID for you.

### [What's an organization name or namespace?](#whats-an-organization-name-or-namespace)

The organization name, sometimes referred to as the organization namespace or the organization ID, is the unique identifier of a Docker organization. The organization name can't be the same as an existing Docker ID.
