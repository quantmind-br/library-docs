# Rivet Engine

## What is Rivet Engine?

Rivet Engine is the backend engine that powers Rivet Actors at scale. It's an optional component of the Rivet ecosystem that provides enterprise-grade infrastructure for running stateful workloads with long-lived processes, durable state, and realtime capabilities.

While you can use RivetKit (the TypeScript library) with a file system or memory driver for development, Rivet Engine provides production-ready infrastructure for:

* **Automatic scaling** from zero to millions of concurrent actors
* **Distributed state management** with fast, in-memory state storage
* **Actor lifecycle management** with hibernation and instant wake-up
* **Built-in resilience** with automatic failover and recovery
* **Edge deployment** for low-latency global distribution

Think of it as the production runtime that takes your RivetKit actors and scales them effortlessly across distributed infrastructure.

### Key Features

* **Production-Ready Scaling**: Automatically scale from zero to millions of concurrent actors with no cold starts
* **Distributed State Storage**: State is stored on the same machine as your compute for ultra-fast reads and writes with no database latency
* **Actor Lifecycle Management**: Actors automatically hibernate when idle and wake instantly on demand, only consuming resources when active
* **Built-In Realtime**: Native support for WebSockets and SSE for realtime state updates and broadcasting
* **Resilient Infrastructure**: Automatic failover and recovery with state integrity preservation
* **Edge-Ready**: Deploy actors close to users for instant interactions
* **Multi-Runtime Support**: Works with Node.js, Bun, Deno, and Cloudflare Workers
* **API Integration**: RESTful API for managing runners, actors, and namespaces
* **Built on Web Standards**: Uses standard HTTP, WebSockets, and SSE protocols

### Use Cases

Rivet Engine powers applications that require:

* **AI Agents**: Durable AI assistants with persistent memory and realtime streaming capabilities
* **Realtime Collaboration**: Collaborative documents, whiteboards, and tools with CRDTs and realtime synchronization
* **Durable Workflows**: Multi-step workflows with automatic state management and recovery
* **Local-First Applications**: Offline-first apps with server-side synchronization and conflict resolution
* **Chatbots & Automation**: Discord, Slack, or autonomous bots with persistent conversation state
* **Per-User Databases**: Isolated data stores for each user with zero-latency access
* **Multiplayer Games**: Authoritative game servers with realtime state synchronization
* **Background Processing**: Scheduled and recurring jobs without external queue infrastructure
* **Rate Limiting**: Distributed rate limiting with in-memory counters and state

### How It Works

Rivet Engine provides a backend runtime that:

1. **Manages Actors**: Coordinates actor lifecycle, hibernation, and wake-up across distributed infrastructure
2. **Handles State**: Stores actor state in memory for fast access, with persistent backup to storage backends
3. **Routes Requests**: Efficiently routes client requests to the correct actor instance
4. **Scales Dynamically**: Automatically spawns and destroys actor instances based on demand
5. **Ensures Resilience**: Monitors health and automatically recovers failed actors with state preservation

### Integration with RivetKit

Rivet Engine works seamlessly with RivetKit, the TypeScript library for building actors:

* **Development**: Use RivetKit with file system or memory drivers for local development
* **Production**: Deploy to Rivet Engine for automatic scaling and enterprise features
* **Self-Hosted**: Run Rivet Engine on your own infrastructure for full control
* **Managed**: Use Rivet Cloud for 1-click deployment with managed infrastructure

### Deployment Options

Deploy Rivet Engine on:

* **Self-Hosted** (Coolify, Docker, Kubernetes)
* **Cloud Platforms** (Vercel, Railway, AWS ECS, Google Cloud Run, Hetzner)
* **Rivet Cloud** (Managed, 1-click deployment)

### Storage Backends

Rivet Engine supports multiple storage backends for actor state:

* PostgreSQL
* File System
* Memory (development/testing)
* Custom storage adapters
