The [`--try-gpt5` experiment](https://ampcode.com/news/gpt-5) is over. GPT-5 is here to stay as the new model for [the oracle](https://ampcode.com/manual#oracle), replacing o3, but no longer as an experimental primary model in Amp.

We found GPT-5 to be surprisingly good in certain contexts, when planning or debugging, for example, which makes it a great model to take on the role of the oracle. But it's also less proactive, less likely to jump over that last hurdle, compared to Sonnet, and these are qualities we look for in the main agent model. Then again, its reasoning capabilities, its different training lineage, and the absence of certain idiosyncracies make it a great partner for Sonnet.

Now GPT-5 is the oracle in Amp. That means you can summon it at any point in an Amp thread to help with complex plans and bugs:

- "Look at the DB query calls and ask the oracle to provide a plan for how to refactor that reduces code duplication"
- "Use the oracle to figure out when `createSupervisor` threads can throw an uncaught error based on the debug log output in `@log.txt`"
- "I don't like that architecture. Use the oracle to analyze the callers and design a better architecture with clearer separation of concerns and pluggable storage."
- "Ask the oracle to review the code we just wrote"

(You can find [more examples](https://ampcode.com/manual#oracle) in the manual.)

Thanks to everybody for testing and evaluating GPT-5 and sharing their experiences with us!

We're still tweaking system prompts, still exploring new mechanics of how to interact with agents, and still thinking about where else we could fit GPT-5 into Amp. Because it is a fascinating model and there has to be a way to get even more out of it.
