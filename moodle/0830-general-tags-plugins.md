&lt;ProjectSummary

## [Frankenstyle component names](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/codingstyle/frankenstyle)

The term 'Frankenstyle component names' refers to the naming convention that is used to uniquely identify a Moodle plugin based on the type of plugin and its name. They are used throughout the Moodle code (with a notable exception being the css class names in the themes).

## [Plugin code prechecks](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/codeprechecks)

In the Moodle Plugins directory, uploaded plugins versions are automatically tested against a set of formal criteria. These tests typically do not check the actual plugin functionality, security or code correctness. They are more focused on formal aspects of the coding style. As such, they are most valuable for the plugin maintainers themselves.

## [Plugin contribution](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution)

This page describes how to contribute your code into the Plugins directory to share it with the Moodle community.

## [Plugin contribution checklist](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/checklist)

Before approaching the Moodle plugins directory and submitting your plugin (or a new plugin version), you are encouraged to go through the checklists below and fix eventual issues with your plugin. Doing so will make the reviewer of your plugin happy :-) and may have impact on how long your plugin has to spend in the approval queue before it lands smoothly.

## [Plugin documentation](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/documentation)

Plugin developers, maintainers and users are welcome to include documentation about their plugin in the English Moodle Docs. Of course it is fine to have documentation elsewhere, such as the Github wiki, however one advantage of including documentation in the English Moodle Docs is that 'Moodle Docs for this page' links in Moodle (when logged in as a teacher or admin) can lead directly to your plugin documentation (as explained in the Header and footer documentation). And, very important, it will then be very easy for translators of Moodle Docs to add translations for this information.

## [Plugin QA prechecks](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/guardians/qaprechecks)

Plugin QA prechecks are for testing the functionality of plugins submitted for approval in the Moodle Plugins directory. Together with code prechecks, they are part of the plugin approval process.

## [Plugin Removal](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/deprecation/plugin-removal)

We regularly assess the standard plugins that are included in Moodle and will, from time-to-time, remove some of these.

## [Plugin with third party libraries](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/thirdpartylibraries)

This page describes the correct way to include third party libraries with your plugin.

## [Plugins adoption programme](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/adoption)

The Plugins adoption programme is a process for making it clear that a plugin is orphaned and is looking for a new maintainer. The programme is one of the mechanisms helping to minimise the risks of relying on additional plugins. The programme helps to find new maintainers for plugins whose original authors can't work on the plugin fully any more.

## [Plugins directory](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/pluginsdirectory)

\- Plugins developed and maintained by community members are listed in the Plugins directory at moodle.org.

## [Plugins directory API](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/pluginsdirectory/api)

The Plugins directory at http://moodle.org/plugins exposes some of its features via web services layer, allowing the community to develop custom tools and integrations with other services such as GitHub Actions or Travis CI.

## [Plugins directory updates](https://moodledev.io/general/community/plugincontribution/pluginsdirectory/updates)

13 December 2023
