You can choose between a monthly or annual billing cycle when purchasing a subscription. If you have a monthly billing cycle, you can choose to switch to an annual billing cycle.

If you're on a monthly plan, you can switch to a yearly plan at any time. However, switching from a yearly to a monthly cycle isn't supported.

For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

You must be an organization owner to make changes to the payment information.
