# Rules

Use rules to control which commands Codex can run outside the sandbox.

<DocsTip>Rules are experimental and may change.</DocsTip>

## Create a rules file

1. Create a `.rules` file under `~/.codex/rules` (for example, `~/.codex/rules/default.rules`).
2. Add a rule. This example prompts before allowing `gh pr view` to run outside the sandbox.

   ```python
   # Prompt before running commands with the prefix `gh pr view` outside the sandbox.
   prefix_rule(
       # The prefix to match.
       pattern = ["gh", "pr", "view"],

       # The action to take when Codex requests to run a matching command.
       decision = "prompt",

       # Optional rationale for why this rule exists.
       justification = "Viewing PRs is allowed with approval",

       # `match` and `not_match` are optional "inline unit tests" where you can
       # provide examples of commands that should (or should not) match this rule.
       match = [
           "gh pr view 7888",
           "gh pr view --repo openai/codex",
           "gh pr view 7888 --json title,body,comments",
       ],
       not_match = [
           # Does not match because the `pattern` must be an exact prefix.
           "gh pr --repo openai/codex view 7888",
       ],
   )
   ```

3. Restart Codex.

Codex loads every `*.rules` file under `~/.codex/rules` at startup. When you add a command to the allow list in the TUI, Codex appends a rule to `~/.codex/rules/default.rules` so future runs can skip the prompt.

## Understand rule fields

`prefix_rule()` supports these fields:

- `pattern` **(required)**: A non-empty list that defines the command prefix to match. Each element is either:
  - A literal string (for example, `"pr"`).
  - A union of literals (for example, `["view", "list"]`) to match alternatives at that argument position.
- `decision` **(defaults to `"allow"`)**: The action to take when the rule matches. Codex applies the most restrictive decision when more than one rule matches (`forbidden` > `prompt` > `allow`).
  - `allow`: Run the command outside the sandbox without prompting.
  - `prompt`: Prompt before each matching invocation.
  - `forbidden`: Block the request without prompting.
- `justification` **(optional)**: A non-empty, human-readable reason for the rule. Codex may surface it in approval prompts or rejection messages. When you use `forbidden`, include a recommended alternative in the justification when appropriate (for example, `"Use \`rg\` instead of \`grep\`."`).
- `match` and `not_match` **(defaults to `[]`)**: Examples that Codex validates when it loads your rules. Use these to catch mistakes before a rule takes effect.

When Codex considers a command to run, it compares the command's argument list to `pattern`. Internally, Codex treats the command as a list of arguments (like what `execvp(3)` receives).

## Test a rule file

Use `codex execpolicy check` to test how your rules apply to a command:

```shell
codex execpolicy check --pretty \
  --rules ~/.codex/rules/default.rules \
  -- gh pr view 7888 --json title,body,comments
```

The command emits JSON showing the strictest decision and any matching rules, including any `justification` values from matched rules. Use more than one `--rules` flag to combine files, and add `--pretty` to format the output.

## Understand the rules language

The `.rules` file format uses `Starlark` (see the [language spec](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark/blob/master/spec.md)). Its syntax is like Python, but it's designed to be safe to run: the rules engine can run it without side effects (for example, touching the filesystem).
