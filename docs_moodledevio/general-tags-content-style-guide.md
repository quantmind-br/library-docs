## [Confirmation messages](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/productwriting/confirm-msg)

Confirmation messages prompt people to confirm actions that have significant consequences or are difficult to undo. They can also help prevent errors or unexpected results by verifying user intent before proceeding with an action.

## [Content principles](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/productwriting/contentprinciples)

Our vision

## [Empty states](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/productwriting/emptystates)

Empty states appear when there's nothing to display to our users. They can happen in a variety of situations:

## [Error messages](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/productwriting/errormsg)

Error messages describe issues that stop users from finishing a task, or the system from functioning properly. A good error message explains what happened, the reason why it happened, and what the user can do to move forward. They may even provide a way forward in the call to action.

## [Grammar and mechanics](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide/grammar)

Structuring content

## [How we write - a focus on translation](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide/translation)

Keep it simple

## [Style guide](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide)

The Moodle Style Guide helps us create a clear and consistent approach to the content we produce: from our website, marketing, and communications to the actual text in Moodle products.

## [Success messages](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/productwriting/success-msg)

Success messages tell users that they've completed a task or achieved a goal, or that an action within the system has been successfully completed.

## [The Moodle content guidelines](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines)

The Moodle content guidelines are for UX writers, copywriters, marketers, developers, translators, and anyone else writing for Moodle. By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that we're effective at communicating key messages to our users, and that we maintain consistency across all parts of the Moodle experience.

## [Values, personality and principles](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide/voice/values)

Our values are the core Moodle beliefs and unify everything we do. Our personality is influenced by our values and describes the set of characteristics that we attribute to Moodle. Or, to put it another way, it's how we describe Moodle as if Moodle were a person. Understanding our brand personality is essential because it helps us connect more deeply to our brand identity and fosters brand loyalty.

## [Voice and tone](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide/voice/voiceandtone)

Our voice and tone are how we express ourselves.

## [Who we are, who we aren't](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide/voice/whoweare)

When representing Moodle either as a team member or as part of our community, it's essential to reflect on who Moodle is and who we aren't. Avoid confrontation in our written, verbal, or other forms of communication.

## [Word list](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/styleguide/wordlist)

This word list contains guidelines on how we use specific terms at Moodle. If you can't find a word here, check the dictionary or use the search function to see if we've addressed it somewhere else in the guide.

## [Writing for accessibility](https://moodledev.io/general/contentguidelines/productwriting/writingforaccessibility)

What does accessibility mean?
