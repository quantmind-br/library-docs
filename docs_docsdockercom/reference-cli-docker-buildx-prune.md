summary: This document explains the usage and options for the docker buildx prune command, which is used to clear the build cache of a selected builder. It details how to manage cache records using specific filters and disk space constraints like maximum used or minimum free space.

### [Include internal/frontend images (--all)](#all)

The `--all` flag to allow clearing internal helper images and frontend images set using the `#syntax=` directive or the `BUILDKIT_SYNTAX` build argument.

### [Provide filter values (--filter)](#filter)

You can finely control which cache records to delete using the `--filter` flag.

The filter format is in the form of `<key><op><value>`, known as selectors. All selectors must match the target object for the filter to be true. We define the operators `=` for equality, `!=` for not equal and `~=` for a regular expression.

Valid filter keys are:

- `until` flag to keep records that have been used in the last duration time. Value is a duration string, e.g. `24h` or `2h30m`, with allowable units of `(h)ours`, `(m)inutes` and `(s)econds`.
- `id` flag to target a specific image ID.
- `parents` flag to target records that are parents of the specified image ID. Multiple parent IDs are separated by a semicolon (`;`).
- `description` flag to target records whose description is the specified substring.
- `inuse` flag to target records that are actively in use and therefore not reclaimable.
- `mutable` flag to target records that are mutable.
- `immutable` flag to target records that are immutable.
- `shared` flag to target records that are shared with other resources, typically images.
- `private` flag to target records that are not shared.
- `type` flag to target records by type. Valid types are:
  
  - `internal`
  - `frontend`
  - `source.local`
  - `source.git.checkout`
  - `exec.cachemount`
  - `regular`

Examples:

> Multiple `--filter` flags are ANDed together.

### [Maximum amount of disk space allowed to keep for cache (--max-used-space)](#max-used-space)

The `--max-used-space` flag allows setting a maximum amount of disk space that the build cache can use. If the cache is using more disk space than this value, the least recently used cache records are deleted until the total used space is less than or equal to the specified value.

The value is specified in bytes. You can use a human-readable memory string, e.g. `128mb`, `2gb`, etc. Units are case-insensitive.

### [Target amount of free disk space after pruning (--min-free-space)](#min-free-space)

The `--min-free-space` flag allows setting a target amount of free disk space that should be available after pruning. If the available disk space is less than this value, the least recently used cache records are deleted until the available free space is greater than or equal to the specified value.

The value is specified in bytes. You can use a human-readable memory string, e.g. `128mb`, `2gb`, etc. Units are case-insensitive.

### [Amount of disk space always allowed to keep for cache (--reserved-space)](#reserved-space)

The `--reserved-space` flag allows setting an amount of disk space that should always be kept for the build cache. If the available disk space is less than this value, the least recently used cache records are deleted until the available free space is greater than or equal to the specified value.

The value is specified in bytes. You can use a human-readable memory string, e.g. `128mb`, `2gb`, etc. Units are case-insensitive.

### [Override the configured builder instance (--builder)](#builder)

Same as [`buildx --builder`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/#builder).
