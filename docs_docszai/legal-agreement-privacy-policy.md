* **With your consent:** any other person, with your consent to the disclosure.

## 5. Your Rights and Choices

Depending on where you live, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information, such as the right to know how we collect and use your personal information. You may also have the right to access, change, oppose, request a copy of your authorization, file complaints before the competent authorities, withdraw your consent, or limit our collection and use of your personal information as well as to request that we delete it, and potentially others. In certain circumstances, you can also ask us to provide additional information about our collection and use of your personal information. Please note that your exercise of certain rights may impact your ability to use some or all of Services' features and functionalities.

* **Right to know:** the right to know what personal data we process about you, including the categories of personal data, the categories of sources from which it is collected, the business or commercial purposes for collection, and the categories of third parties to whom we disclose it.
* **Access & data portability:** the right to request a copy of the personal data we process about you, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. In certain cases and subject to applicable law, you have the right to port your information.

* **Objection:** the right to object to processing of your personal data, including profiling conducted on grounds of public or legitimate interest.

Please contact us by using the contact information provided in this Privacy Policy if you would like to exercise any of your rights. We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law and subject to proper verification.

## 6. The Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your personal data is a priority for us. We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, theft, disclosure, alteration, or loss. We regularly assess our security practices to incorporate new technologies and methods. However, please note that no Internet or email transmission is completely secure or error-free. Specifically, emails sent to or from us may not be fully secure. As a result, we advise you to exercise caution when deciding what information to send to us via the Services or email. Additionally, we are not responsible for any bypassing of privacy settings or security measures on the Service or third-party websites.

## 7. How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data

We retain personal data for as long as it is needed to provide our Services and for the other purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Additionally, we retain personal data when required to fulfill contractual and legal obligations, when we have a legitimate business interest (such as improving and developing our Services and enhancing their safety, security, and stability), and for the exercise or defense of legal claims.

Retention periods vary based on the volume, type, and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which we use it, and any legal requirements, among other factors. For instance, when we process your personal data to provide you with the Services, we retain it as long as you have an account. This includes your account information, input. If you violate any of our terms, policies, or guidelines, we may immediately remove your account information, input from public view, but we will keep the personal data as needed to address the violation.

When the personal data collected is no longer required by us, we and our service providers will perform the necessary procedures for destroying, deleting, erasing, or converting it into an anonymous form as permitted or required under applicable laws.

## 8. Where We Store Your Personal Data

Depending on your location and the features of our Services that you access or use, your personal data may be transferred and processed outside the jurisdiction in which you reside, including to an affiliated company within the Z.ai Group or a third party (as outlined in section 4) located overseas.

We generally provide the Services from Singapore, and our group companies and their designated service providers are typically located in Singapore. As a result, your personal data is generally processed in Singapore.

We implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal data remains protected in line with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws, and we only transfer your data abroad in compliance with applicable laws and legally recognized transfer mechanisms.

## 9. Personal Data relating to children
