Extensions can be used to make your Compose file more efficient and easier to maintain.

Use the prefix `x-` as a top-level element to modularize configurations that you want to reuse. Compose ignores any fields that start with `x-`, this is the sole exception where Compose silently ignores unrecognized fields.

Extensions can also be used with [anchors and aliases](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/fragments/).

They also can be used within any structure in a Compose file where user-defined keys are not expected. Compose uses those to enable experimental features, the same way browsers add support for [custom CSS features](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/syndata.html#vendor-keywords)

## [Example 1](#example-1)

```
x-custom:foo:- bar- zotservices:webapp:image:example/webappx-foo:bar
```

```
service:backend:deploy:placement:x-aws-role:"arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/foo"x-aws-region:"eu-west-3"x-azure-region:"france-central"
```

## [Example 2](#example-2)

```
x-env:&envenvironment:- CONFIG_KEY- EXAMPLE_KEYservices:first:<<:*envimage:my-image:latestsecond:<<:*envimage:another-image:latest
```

In this example, the environment variables do not belong to either of the services. They’ve been lifted out completely into the `x-env` extension field. This defines a new node which contains the environment field. The `&env` YAML anchor is used so both services can reference the extension field’s value as `*env`.

## [Example 3](#example-3)

```
x-function:&functionlabels:function:"true"depends_on:- gatewaynetworks:- functionsdeploy:placement:constraints:- 'node.platform.os == linux'services:# Node.js gives OS info about the node (Host)nodeinfo:<<:*functionimage:functions/nodeinfo:latestenvironment:no_proxy:"gateway"https_proxy:$https_proxy# Uses `cat` to echo back response, fastest function to execute.echoit:<<:*functionimage:functions/alpine:healthenvironment:fprocess:"cat"no_proxy:"gateway"https_proxy:$https_proxy
```

The `nodeinfo` and `echoit` services both include the `x-function` extension via the `&function` anchor, then set their specific image and environment.

## [Example 4](#example-4)

Using [YAML merge](https://yaml.org/type/merge.html) it is also possible to use multiple extensions and share and override additional attributes for specific needs:

```
x-environment:&default-environmentFOO:BARZOT:QUIXx-keys:&keysKEY:VALUEservices:frontend:image:example/webappenvironment:<< :[*default-environment,*keys]YET_ANOTHER:VARIABLE
```

> Note
> 
> [YAML merge](https://yaml.org/type/merge.html) only applies to mappings, and can't be used with sequences.
> 
> In the example above, the environment variables are declared using the `FOO: BAR` mapping syntax, while the sequence syntax `- FOO=BAR` is only valid when no fragments are involved.

## [Informative historical notes](#informative-historical-notes)

This section is informative. At the time of writing, the following prefixes are known to exist:

## [Specifying byte values](#specifying-byte-values)

Values express a byte value as a string in `{amount}{byte unit}` format: The supported units are `b` (bytes), `k` or `kb` (kilo bytes), `m` or `mb` (mega bytes) and `g` or `gb` (giga bytes).

## [Specifying durations](#specifying-durations)

Values express a duration as a string in the form of `{value}{unit}`. The supported units are `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes) and `h` (hours). Values can combine multiple values without separator.
