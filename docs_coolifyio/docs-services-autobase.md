# Autobase

## What is Autobase?

**Autobase for PostgreSQL®** is an open-source alternative to cloud-managed databases (DBaaS) such as Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, Azure Database, and others.

This automated database platform enables you to create and manage production-ready, highly available PostgreSQL clusters. It simplifies the deployment process, reduces operational costs, and makes database management accessible even for teams without specialized expertise.

*Automate deployment, failover, backups, restore, upgrades, scaling, and more with ease.*

Say goodbye to manual database management 👋
