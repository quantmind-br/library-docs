# What is GoatCounter?

GoatCounter is an open source web analytics platform. It aims to offer easy to use and meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics.

* Privacy-aware; doesn’t track users with unique identifiers and doesn't need a GDPR notice. Fine-grained control over which data is collected.

* Lightweight and fast; adds just ~3.5K of extra data to your site. Also has JavaScript-free "tracking pixel" option, or you can use it from your application's middleware or import from logfiles.

* Identify unique visits without cookies using a non-identifiable hash.

* Keeps useful statistics such as browser information, location, and screen size. Keep track of referring sites and campaigns.

* Easy; if you've been confused by the myriad of options and flexibility of Google Analytics and Matomo that you don't need then GoatCounter will be a breath of fresh air.

* Accessibility is a high-priority feature, and the interface works well with assistive technology such as screen readers.
