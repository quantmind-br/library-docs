To help ensure consistency across documentation, the Technical Writing team recommends these wording choices.

#### [& (ampersand)](#-ampersand)

Don't use `&` instead of `and` in headings, text, navigation, UI copy, or tables of contents.

#### [above](#above)

Try to avoid using `above` when referring to an example or table in a documentation page. If required, use `previous` instead.

For example:

*In the previous example, the dog had fleas.*

#### [account name](#account-name)

Don't use. Instead, use `username`.

#### [admin](#admin)

Write out `administrator` on first use. Use `admin` if it's the name of a UI label or other element.

#### [allows](#allows)

Don't use. Instead, use `lets`.

#### [as of this writing](#as-of-this-writing)

Avoid because the writing itself implies this phrase. The phrase can also prematurely share product or feature strategy or inappropriately imply that a product or feature might change.

#### [below](#below)

Try to avoid `below` when referring to an example or table on a documentation page. If required, use `following` instead.

For example:

*In the following example, the dog had fleas.*

#### [checkbox](#checkbox)

Use one word for `checkbox`. Don't use `check box`.

You select (not check or enable) and clear (not deselect or disable) checkboxes.

#### [click](#click)

Don't use `click`. Instead, use `select` with buttons, links, menu items, and lists.

Select applies to more devices, while click is more specific to a mouse.

#### [currently](#currently)

Don't use `currently` when talking about the product or its features. The documentation describes the product as it is today.

#### [disable](#disable)

Don't use `disable`. Implies that disability is a less-desired or negative state.

Instead, use `turn off` or `toggle off`.

There are times with more technical features when the development team uses `disable`, and in these cases, it's OK to use the term.

#### [earlier](#earlier)

Use `earlier` when talking about version numbers.

Use:

*In Docker Desktop 4.1 and earlier.*

Instead of:

*In Docker Desktop 4.1 and lower.*

#### [easy, easily](#easy-easily)

What might be easy for you might not be easy for others. Try eliminating this word from the sentence because usually the same meaning can be conveyed without it.

#### [e.g.](#eg)

Don't use. Instead, use phrases like `for example` or `such as`.

#### [enable](#enable)

Don't use `enable`. Implies that disability is a less-desired or negative state.

Instead, use `turn on` or `toggle on`.

There are times with more technical features when the development team uses `enable`, and in these cases, it's OK to use the term.

#### [execute](#execute)

Avoid where possible. Use `run` instead.

#### [later](#later)

Use `later` when talking about version numbers.

Use:

*In Docker Desktop 4.1 and later.*

Instead of:

*In Docker Desktop 4.1 and higher…* or *In Docker Desktop 4.1 and above…*

#### [please](#please)

Don't use `please` in the normal course of explaining how to use a product, even if you're explaining a difficult task. Also don't use the phrase `please note`.

#### [register](#register)

Use `sign up` instead of register when talking about creating an account.

#### [repo](#repo)

Don't use. Instead, use `repository`.

#### [respectively](#respectively)

Avoid `respectively` and be more precise instead.

#### [scroll](#scroll)

Avoid. Use a verb phrase such as *move through* or *navigate to* instead, if the context is clear.

#### [sign in](#sign-in)

Use `sign in` instead of `sign on`, `signon`, `log on`, `logon`, or `log in`, `login`. If the user interface uses different words, use those.

Use `sign in to` instead of `sign into`.

#### [sign up](#sign-up)

Use `sign up` or `create account` instead of `register` when talking about creating an account.

#### [tab versus view](#tab-versus-view)

Use `view` when referring to a major section in a UI. Use `tab` when referring to a sub-section in the UI.

For example, in Docker Desktop, the **Images** view and the **Local** tab.

#### [toggle](#toggle)

You turn on or turn off a toggle. For example:

*Turn on the dark mode toggle.*

#### [upgrade](#upgrade)

Use `upgrade` when describing a higher subscription tier

#### [vs](#vs)

Don't use `vs` or `vs.` as an abbreviation for versus; instead, use the unabbreviated `versus`.

#### [we](#we)

Try to avoid `we` and focus instead on how the user can carry out something in Docker.

Use:

*Use widgets when you have work you want to organize.*

Instead of:

*We created a feature for you to add widgets.*

#### [wish](#wish)

Don't use. Use `want` instead.
