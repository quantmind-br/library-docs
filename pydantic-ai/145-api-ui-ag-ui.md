        injected into the `state` field of a `deps` object that implements the [`StateHandler`][pydantic_ai.ui.StateHandler] protocol.
        To provide different `deps` for each request (e.g. based on the authenticated user),
        use [`AGUIAdapter.run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter.run_stream] or

                no output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's
                output type.

            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.

            toolsets: Optional additional toolsets for this run.

            on_complete: Optional callback function called when the agent run completes successfully.
                The callback receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult] and can access `all_messages()` and other result data.

            routes: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
            middleware: A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette application will always
                automatically include two middleware classes. `ServerErrorMiddleware` is added as the very
                outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.
                `ExceptionMiddleware` is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled
                exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints.

                take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
