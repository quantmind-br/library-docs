# WebChat (Gateway WebSocket UI)

Status: the macOS/iOS SwiftUI chat UI talks directly to the Gateway WebSocket.

## What it is

* A native chat UI for the gateway (no embedded browser and no local static server).
* Uses the same sessions and routing rules as other channels.
* Deterministic routing: replies always go back to WebChat.

## Quick start

1. Start the gateway.
2. Open the WebChat UI (macOS/iOS app) or the Control UI chat tab.
3. Ensure gateway auth is configured (required by default, even on loopback).

## How it works (behavior)

* The UI connects to the Gateway WebSocket and uses `chat.history`, `chat.send`, and `chat.inject`.
* `chat.inject` appends an assistant note directly to the transcript and broadcasts it to the UI (no agent run).
* History is always fetched from the gateway (no local file watching).
* If the gateway is unreachable, WebChat is read-only.

## Remote use

* Remote mode tunnels the gateway WebSocket over SSH/Tailscale.
* You do not need to run a separate WebChat server.

## Configuration reference (WebChat)

Full configuration: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration)

Channel options:

* No dedicated `webchat.*` block. WebChat uses the gateway endpoint + auth settings below.

Related global options:

* `gateway.port`, `gateway.bind`: WebSocket host/port.
* `gateway.auth.mode`, `gateway.auth.token`, `gateway.auth.password`: WebSocket auth.
* `gateway.remote.url`, `gateway.remote.token`, `gateway.remote.password`: remote gateway target.
* `session.*`: session storage and main key defaults.
