## [Shortlinks](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.1/apis/subsystems/routing/shortlinks)

Shortlinks are concise URLs that route to a fully-qualified URL in Moodle. Comprising of a smaller set of characters, their use is suitable for SMS, convenience, or where a longer URL would not be suitable.

## [Unit Testing](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.1/apis/subsystems/routing/testing)

One of the benefits of using routes is how easy they are to unit test. It is also possible to test parameters for validation, which is especially useful for mapped parameters.
