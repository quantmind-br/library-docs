# Feature Maturity

Some Codex features ship behind a maturity label so you can understand how reliable each one is, what might change, and what level of support to expect.

| Maturity          | What it means                                                                                                 | Guidance                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Under development | Not ready for use.                                                                                            | Don't use.                                                                    |
| Experimental      | Unstable and OpenAI may remove or change it.                                                                  | Use at your own risk.                                                         |
| Beta              | Ready for broad testing; complete in most respects, but some aspects may change based on user feedback.       | OK for most evaluation and pilots; expect small changes.                      |
| Stable            | Fully supported, documented, and ready for broad use; behavior and configuration remain consistent over time. | Safe for production use; removals typically go through a deprecation process. |
