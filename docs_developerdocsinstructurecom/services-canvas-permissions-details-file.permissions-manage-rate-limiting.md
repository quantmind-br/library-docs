## Site Admin - Rate Limiting

Allows user to create new rate limit settings for external tools and integrations.

Allows user to modify existing rate limit settings, including changing rate limit values and comments.

Allows user to remove rate limit settings for external tools and integrations.

Allows user to view all rate limit settings and their details.

### Additional Considerations

This permission is only available to Site Admin users and requires the api\_rate\_limits feature flag to be enabled.

Rate limiting settings apply to external tools and integrations that use OAuth client configurations with throttling parameters.

This feature supports UTID (Unified Tool ID) based rate limiting for partner tools and products.
