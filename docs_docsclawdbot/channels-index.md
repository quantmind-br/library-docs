# Chat Channels

Clawdbot can talk to you on any chat app you already use. Each channel connects via the Gateway.
Text is supported everywhere; media and reactions vary by channel.

## Supported channels

* [WhatsApp](/channels/whatsapp) — Most popular; uses Baileys and requires QR pairing.
* [Telegram](/channels/telegram) — Bot API via grammY; supports groups.
* [Discord](/channels/discord) — Discord Bot API + Gateway; supports servers, channels, and DMs.
* [Slack](/channels/slack) — Bolt SDK; workspace apps.
* [Google Chat](/channels/googlechat) — Google Chat API app via HTTP webhook.
* [Mattermost](/channels/mattermost) — Bot API + WebSocket; channels, groups, DMs (plugin, installed separately).
* [Signal](/channels/signal) — signal-cli; privacy-focused.
* [BlueBubbles](/channels/bluebubbles) — **Recommended for iMessage**; uses the BlueBubbles macOS server REST API with full feature support (edit, unsend, effects, reactions, group management — edit currently broken on macOS 26 Tahoe).
* [iMessage](/channels/imessage) — macOS only; native integration via imsg (legacy, consider BlueBubbles for new setups).
* [Microsoft Teams](/channels/msteams) — Bot Framework; enterprise support (plugin, installed separately).
* [Nextcloud Talk](/channels/nextcloud-talk) — Self-hosted chat via Nextcloud Talk (plugin, installed separately).
* [Matrix](/channels/matrix) — Matrix protocol (plugin, installed separately).
* [Nostr](/channels/nostr) — Decentralized DMs via NIP-04 (plugin, installed separately).
* [Tlon](/channels/tlon) — Urbit-based messenger (plugin, installed separately).
* [Zalo](/channels/zalo) — Zalo Bot API; Vietnam's popular messenger (plugin, installed separately).
* [Zalo Personal](/channels/zalouser) — Zalo personal account via QR login (plugin, installed separately).
* [WebChat](/web/webchat) — Gateway WebChat UI over WebSocket.

## Notes

* Channels can run simultaneously; configure multiple and Clawdbot will route per chat.
* Fastest setup is usually **Telegram** (simple bot token). WhatsApp requires QR pairing and
  stores more state on disk.
* Group behavior varies by channel; see [Groups](/concepts/groups).
* DM pairing and allowlists are enforced for safety; see [Security](/gateway/security).
* Telegram internals: [grammY notes](/channels/grammy).
* Troubleshooting: [Channel troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting).
* Model providers are documented separately; see [Model Providers](/providers/models).
