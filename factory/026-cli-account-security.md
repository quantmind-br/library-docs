## Security-First Design

Factory CLI (Droid) is built with security at its core. Your code stays secure through encrypted authentication, strict permissions, and enterprise-grade protections.

## Built-in Protections

Factory CLI includes multiple layers of security:

- **Write access restriction**: Can only modify files in the project directory and subdirectories
- **Command approval**: Risky operations require explicit user confirmation
- **Prompt injection detection**: Analyzes requests for potentially harmful instructions
- **Network request controls**: Web-fetching tools require approval by default
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection attacks
- **Session isolation**: Each conversation maintains separate, secure context
