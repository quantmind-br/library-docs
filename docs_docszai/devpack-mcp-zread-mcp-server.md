# Zread MCP Server

<Info>
  The Zread MCP Server is a Z.AI implementation based on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Powered by [zread.ai](https://zread.ai), it provides Claude Code, Cline, and other MCP-compatible clients with knowledge documentation and code access capabilities for open source repositories.
</Info>

## Overview

<Tip>
  This remote MCP server with open source repository Q\&A capability is available to users on **GLM Coding Plan**, enabling your code agent to deeply understand open source projects and efficiently fetch documentation, code structure, and file content.
</Tip>

## Features

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Documentation Search" icon="book">
    Search documentation, code, and comments in Github repositories
  </Card>

  <Card title="Repository Structure" icon="sitemap">
    Get the directory structure and file list of GitHub repositories to quickly master project layout
  </Card>

  <Card title="Code Reading" icon="code">
    Read the complete code content of specified files in GitHub repositories to deeply analyze implementation details

</CardGroup>

## Tools

This server implements the Model Context Protocol and works with any MCP-compatible client. Currently, it provides the following tools:

* **`search_doc`** — Search for knowledge documentation corresponding to the GitHub repository, quickly understanding repository knowledge, news, recent issues, PRs, and contributors.
* **`get_repo_structure`** — Get the directory structure and file list of the GitHub repository to understand project module splitting and directory organization.
* **`read_file`** — Read the complete code content of specified files in the GitHub repository to deeply analyze the implementation details of the file code.

## Installation and Usage

### Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    Visit [Z.AI Console](https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list) to get your api key
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure MCP Server">
    According to the client you’re using, **choose the corresponding installation method from the options below**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Supported Clients

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    **One-click install command**

    Replace `your_api_key` with the API key you obtained in the previous step

    ```bash  theme={null}
    claude mcp add -s user -t http zread https://api.z.ai/api/mcp/zread/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
    ```

    **Manual configuration**

    Edit the Claude Code configuration file under your home directory, the MCP section of `.claude.json`:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "zread": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://api.z.ai/api/mcp/zread/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cline (VS Code)">
    Add the MCP server configuration in the Cline extension settings:

    Replace `your_api_key` with the API key you obtained in the previous step

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "zread": {
          "type": "streamableHttp",
          "url": "https://api.z.ai/api/mcp/zread/mcp",
          "headers": {
            "Authorization": "Bearer your_api_key"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    If Cline older version does not support StreamableHttp type MCP server, you can use SSE type configuration:

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "zread": {
          "type": "sse",
          "url": "https://api.z.ai/api/mcp/zread/sse?Authorization=your_api_key"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="OpenCode">
    Add the MCP server configuration in OpenCode settings:

    See the [OpenCode MCP documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/mcp-servers)

    Replace `your_api_key` with the API key you obtained in the previous step

    ```json  theme={null}
    {
        "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
        "mcp": {
            "zread": {
