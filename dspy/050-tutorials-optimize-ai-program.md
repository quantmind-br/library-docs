## Optimize AI Programs with DSPy[¶](#optimize-ai-programs-with-dspy "Permanent link")

This section focuses on DSPy's powerful optimization capabilities, demonstrating how to systematically improve your AI programs using various optimizers. These tutorials are lighter on programming concepts and instead showcase how DSPy optimizers can automatically enhance the quality and performance of your applications.

## Mathematical and Reasoning Tasks[¶](#mathematical-and-reasoning-tasks "Permanent link")

### [Math Reasoning](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/math/)[¶](#math-reasoning "Permanent link")

Learn how to optimize DSPy programs for mathematical reasoning tasks. This tutorial demonstrates how optimizers can dramatically improve performance on complex math problems by finding better prompting strategies and few-shot examples.

## Model Optimization[¶](#model-optimization "Permanent link")

### [Classification Finetuning](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/classification_finetuning/)[¶](#classification-finetuning "Permanent link")

Discover how to use DSPy's finetuning optimizers to distill knowledge from large language models into smaller, more efficient models. Learn the complete workflow from prompt optimization to model finetuning for classification tasks.

### [Advanced Tool Use](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/tool_use/)[¶](#advanced-tool-use "Permanent link")

Explore how to optimize AI programs that use external tools and APIs. This tutorial shows how DSPy optimizers can learn to use tools more effectively, improving both accuracy and efficiency in tool-calling scenarios.

### [Finetuning Agents](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/games/)[¶](#finetuning-agents "Permanent link")

Learn to optimize complex agent-based systems through finetuning. This tutorial demonstrates how to improve agent performance in interactive environments like games, where strategic thinking and adaptation are crucial.
