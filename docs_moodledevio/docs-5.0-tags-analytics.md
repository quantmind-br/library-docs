## [Analytics API](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.0/apis/subsystems/analytics)

The Analytics API allows managers to use predictions to detect trends and predict student behaviour

## [Machine learning backends](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.0/apis/plugintypes/mlbackend)

Machine learning backends process the datasets generated from the indicators and targets calculated by the Analytics API. They are used for machine learning training, prediction and models evaluation.
