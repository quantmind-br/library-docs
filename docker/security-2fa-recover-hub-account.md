This page explains how to recover your Docker account and manage recovery codes for two-factor authentication.

## [Generate a new recovery code](#generate-a-new-recovery-code)

If you lost your two-factor authentication recovery code but still have access to your Docker Hub account, you can generate a new recovery code.

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login) with your username and password.
2. Select your avatar and from the drop-down menu, select **Account settings**.
3. Select **2FA**.
4. Enter your password, then select **Confirm**.
5. Select **Generate new code**.

This generates a new code. Select the visibility icon to view the code. Save your recovery code and store it somewhere safe.

## [Recover your account without access](#recover-your-account-without-access)

If you lost access to both your two-factor authentication application and your recovery code:

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login) with your username and password.
2. Select **I've lost my authentication device** and **I've lost my recovery code**.
3. Complete the [Contact Support form](https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/?category=2fa-lockout).

You must enter the primary email address associated with your Docker ID in the Contact Support form for recovery instructions.
