* [Multimodal AI Translator:](https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/cfworkers-ai-translate) This application uses Cloudflare Workers AI to perform multimodal translation of languages via audio and text in the browser.
* [Floor is Llava:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/floor-is-llava-workers-ai) This is an example repo to explore using the AI Vision model Llava hosted on Cloudflare Workers AI. This is a SvelteKit app hosted on Pages.
* [Workers AI Object Detector:](https://github.com/elizabethsiegle/cf-workers-ai-obj-detection-webcam) Detect objects from a webcam in a Cloudflare Worker web app with detr-resnet-50 hosted on Cloudflare using Cloudflare Workers AI.
* [Comically Bad Art Generation:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/comically-bad-art-workers-ai-streamlit) This app uses the wonderful Python UI Framework Streamlit and Cloudflare Workers AI.
* [Whatever-ify:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/whatever-ify-workers-ai) Turn yourself into...whatever. Take a photo, get a description, generate a scene and character, then generate an image based on that calendar.
* [Phoney AI:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/phoney-ai) This application uses Cloudflare Workers AI, Twilio, and AssemblyAI. Your phone is an input and output device.
* [Image Model Streamlit starters:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/image-model-streamlit-workers-ai) Collection of Streamlit applications that are making use of Cloudflare Workers AI.
* [Vanilla JavaScript Chat Application using Cloudflare Workers AI:](https://github.com/craigsdennis/vanilla-chat-workers-ai) A web based chat interface built on Cloudflare Pages that allows for exploring Text Generation models on Cloudflare Workers AI. Design is built using tailwind.
