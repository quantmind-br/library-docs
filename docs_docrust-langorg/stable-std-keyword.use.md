Expand description

Import or rename items from other crates or modules, use values under ergonomic clones semantic, or specify precise capturing with `use<..>`.

### [§](#importing-items)Importing items

The `use` keyword is employed to shorten the path required to refer to a module item. The keyword may appear in modules, blocks, and even functions, typically at the top.

The most basic usage of the keyword is `use path::to::item;`, though a number of convenient shortcuts are supported:

- Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix, using the glob-like brace syntax `use a::b::{c, d, e::f, g::h::i};`
- Simultaneously binding a list of paths with a common prefix and their common parent module, using the [`self`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.self.html) keyword, such as `use a::b::{self, c, d::e};`
- Rebinding the target name as a new local name, using the syntax `use p::q::r as x;`. This can also be used with the last two features: `use a::b::{self as ab, c as abc}`.
- Binding all paths matching a given prefix, using the asterisk wildcard syntax `use a::b::*;`.
- Nesting groups of the previous features multiple times, such as `use a::b::{self as ab, c, d::{*, e::f}};`
- Reexporting with visibility modifiers such as `pub use a::b;`
- Importing with `_` to only import the methods of a trait without binding it to a name (to avoid conflict for example): `use ::std::io::Read as _;`.

Using path qualifiers like [`crate`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.crate.html), [`super`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.super.html) or [`self`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/keyword.self.html) is supported: `use crate::a::b;`.

Note that when the wildcard `*` is used on a type, it does not import its methods (though for `enum`s it imports the variants, as shown in the example below).

[ⓘ](# "This example deliberately fails to compile")

```rust
enum ExampleEnum {
    VariantA,
    VariantB,
}

impl ExampleEnum {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self::VariantA
    }
}

use ExampleEnum::*;

// Compiles.
let _ = VariantA;

// Does not compile!
let n = new();
```

For more information on `use` and paths in general, see the [Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/use-declarations.html).

The differences about paths and the `use` keyword between the 2015 and 2018 editions can also be found in the [Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/items/use-declarations.html).

### [§](#precise-capturing)Precise capturing

The `use<..>` syntax is used within certain `impl Trait` bounds to control which generic parameters are captured. This is important for return-position `impl Trait` (RPIT) types, as it affects borrow checking by controlling which generic parameters can be used in the hidden type.

For example, the following function demonstrates an error without precise capturing in Rust 2021 and earlier editions:

[ⓘ](# "This example deliberately fails to compile")

```rust
fn f(x: &()) -> impl Sized { x }
```

By using `use<'_>` for precise capturing, it can be resolved:

```rust
fn f(x: &()) -> impl Sized + use<'_> { x }
```

This syntax specifies that the elided lifetime be captured and therefore available for use in the hidden type.

In Rust 2024, opaque types automatically capture all lifetime parameters in scope. `use<..>` syntax serves as an important way of opting-out of that default.

For more details about precise capturing, see the [Reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/reference/types/impl-trait.html).

### [§](#ergonomic-clones)Ergonomic clones

Use a values, copying its content if the value implements `Copy`, cloning the contents if the value implements `UseCloned` or moving it otherwise.
