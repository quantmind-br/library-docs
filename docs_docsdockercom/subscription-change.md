For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

You can upgrade or downgrade your Docker subscription at any time to match your changing needs. This page explains how to make subscription changes and what to expect with billing and feature access.

When you upgrade your Docker subscription, you immediately get access to all features and entitlements in your new subscription tier. For detailed feature information, see [Docker Pricing](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

You can downgrade your Docker subscription at any time before the renewal date. The unused portion isn't refundable, but you retain access to paid features until the next billing cycle.

You can't pause or delay a subscription. If a subscription invoice isn't paid by the due date, there's a 15-day grace period starting from the due date.
