## Dynamic Seat Allocation

With dynamic seat allocation, account admins can allocate unused seats to developers, effectively multiplying their daily limits. This feature is perfect for high-intensity development periods when specific members or teams need more capacity.

### Available Allocation Options

- **×2 Allocation**: Doubles your daily usage limits by consuming 2 seats
- **×5 Allocation**: Increases your daily limits by 5x by consuming 5 seats

### How It Works

![Dynamic Seat Allocation Walkthrough](https://mintcdn.com/forgoodaiinc/pP_7T1_dI3RIImWx/images/seat-multiplier-walkthrough.gif?s=fd4bc04b4f86011e4096d75ca6547f8c) Dynamic seat allocation is controlled through your Admin Panel, giving you the flexibility to scale your usage based on your current development needs. When you enable an allocation option, it consumes the corresponding number of seats from your available subscription pool.
