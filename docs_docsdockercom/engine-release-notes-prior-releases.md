## Docker Engine prior releases

> On Linux distributions where `devicemapper` was the default storage driver, the `overlay2`, or `overlay` is now used by default (if the kernel supports it). To use devicemapper, you can manually configure the storage driver to use through the `--storage-driver` daemon option, or by setting "storage-driver" in the `daemon.json` configuration file.

> In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12 *before* upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon starts:

```
Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv
```

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:

1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

> Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When upgrading from an older version of Docker, the upgrade process may not automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start the `docker service` if;
> 
> - the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
> - a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the `docker service` will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:

- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

> Docker 1.12.5 will correctly validate that either an IPv6 subnet is provided or that the IPAM driver can provide one when you specify the `--ipv6` option.

If you are currently using the `--ipv6` option *without* specifying the `--fixed-cidr-v6` option, the Docker daemon will refuse to start with the following message:

To resolve this error, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag.

In a similar way, if you specify the `--ipv6` flag when creating a network with the default IPAM driver, without providing an IPv6 `--subnet`, network creation will fail with the following message:

To resolve this, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the `--subnet` flag.

The network creation will instead succeed if you use an external IPAM driver which supports automatic allocation of IPv6 subnets.

> Docker 1.12.0 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When upgrading from an older version of Docker, the upgrade process may not automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start the `docker service` if;
> 
> - the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
> - a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the `docker service` will produce an error:

```
Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.
```

or

```
no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.
```

To resolve this:

- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

> With Docker 1.12, a Linux `docker` installation now has two additional binaries; `dockerd`, and `docker-proxy`. If you have scripts for installing `docker`, make sure to update them accordingly.

### [Notable features since 0.7.0](#notable-features-since-070)

- Images and containers can be removed much faster
- Building an image from source with docker build is now much faster
- The Docker daemon starts and stops much faster
- The memory footprint of many common operations has been reduced, by streaming files instead of buffering them in memory, fixing memory leaks, and fixing various suboptimal memory allocations
- Several race conditions were fixed, making Docker more stable under very high concurrency load. This makes Docker more stable and less likely to crash and reduces the memory footprint of many common operations
- All packaging operations are now built on the Go language’s standard tar implementation, which is bundled with Docker itself. This makes packaging more portable across host distributions, and solves several issues caused by quirks and incompatibilities between different distributions of tar
- Docker can now create, remove and modify larger numbers of containers and images graciously thanks to more aggressive releasing of system resources. For example the storage driver API now allows Docker to do reference counting on mounts created by the drivers With the ongoing changes to the networking and execution subsystems of docker testing these areas have been a focus of the refactoring. By moving these subsystems into separate packages we can test, analyze, and monitor coverage and quality of these packages
- Many components have been separated into smaller sub-packages, each with a dedicated test suite. As a result the code is better-tested, more readable and easier to change
- The ADD instruction now supports caching, which avoids unnecessarily re-uploading the same source content again and again when it hasn’t changed
- The new ONBUILD instruction adds to your image a “trigger” instruction to be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build
