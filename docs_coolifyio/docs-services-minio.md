# MinIO Community Edition

![MinIO](/images/services/minio-logo.svg)

::: danger SERVICE REMOVED FROM COOLIFY
This service has been removed from Coolify’s one-click service catalog because it no longer receives official Docker images and is currently in maintenance mode by the original author. You can find more information about the project’s maintenance status [here](https://github.com/minio/minio?tab=readme-ov-file#maintenance-mode)

The last Docker image published by the original author does not include a fix for the following security vulnerability: https://github.com/minio/minio/security/advisories/GHSA-jjjj-jwhf-8rgr

We recommend using the **Community-maintained MinIO service on Coolify**, which provides automated Docker builds based on the official MinIO codebase. You can learn more about using the Community version [here](/services/minio-community-edition)

## FAQ

### Invalid login credentials

You need to run MinIO on `https` (not self-signed) to avoid this issue. MinIO doesn't support http based authentication.
