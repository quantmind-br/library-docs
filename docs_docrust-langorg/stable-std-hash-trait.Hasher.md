Expand description

A trait for hashing an arbitrary stream of bytes.

Instances of `Hasher` usually represent state that is changed while hashing data.

`Hasher` provides a fairly basic interface for retrieving the generated hash (with [`finish`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#tymethod.finish "method std::hash::Hasher::finish")), and writing integers as well as slices of bytes into an instance (with [`write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#tymethod.write "method std::hash::Hasher::write") and [`write_u8`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#method.write_u8 "method std::hash::Hasher::write_u8") etc.). Most of the time, `Hasher` instances are used in conjunction with the [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html "trait std::hash::Hash") trait.

This trait provides no guarantees about how the various `write_*` methods are defined and implementations of [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html "trait std::hash::Hash") should not assume that they work one way or another. You cannot assume, for example, that a [`write_u32`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#method.write_u32 "method std::hash::Hasher::write_u32") call is equivalent to four calls of [`write_u8`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#method.write_u8 "method std::hash::Hasher::write_u8"). Nor can you assume that adjacent `write` calls are merged, so it’s possible, for example, that

```rust
hasher.write(&[1, 2]);
hasher.write(&[3, 4, 5, 6]);
```

and

```rust
hasher.write(&[1, 2, 3, 4]);
hasher.write(&[5, 6]);
```

end up producing different hashes.

Thus to produce the same hash value, [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html "trait std::hash::Hash") implementations must ensure for equivalent items that exactly the same sequence of calls is made – the same methods with the same parameters in the same order.

## [§](#examples)Examples

```rust
use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hasher};

let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();

hasher.write_u32(1989);
hasher.write_u8(11);
hasher.write_u8(9);
hasher.write(b"Huh?");

println!("Hash is {:x}!", hasher.finish());
```

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/src/core/hash/mod.rs.html#334)

Returns the hash value for the values written so far.

Despite its name, the method does not reset the hasher’s internal state. Additional [`write`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#tymethod.write "method std::hash::Hasher::write")s will continue from the current value. If you need to start a fresh hash value, you will have to create a new hasher.

##### [§](#examples-1)Examples

```rust
use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hasher};

let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
hasher.write(b"Cool!");

println!("Hash is {:x}!", hasher.finish());
```

1.0.0 · [Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/src/core/hash/mod.rs.html#357)

Writes some data into this `Hasher`.

##### [§](#examples-2)Examples

```rust
use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hasher};

let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
let data = [0x01, 0x23, 0x45, 0x67, 0x89, 0xab, 0xcd, 0xef];

hasher.write(&data);

println!("Hash is {:x}!", hasher.finish());
```

##### [§](#note-to-implementers)Note to Implementers

You generally should not do length-prefixing as part of implementing this method. It’s up to the [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html "trait std::hash::Hash") implementation to call [`Hasher::write_length_prefix`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#method.write_length_prefix "method std::hash::Hasher::write_length_prefix") before sequences that need it.

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`hasher_prefixfree_extras` [#96762](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/96762))

Writes a length prefix into this hasher, as part of being prefix-free.

If you’re implementing [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html "trait std::hash::Hash") for a custom collection, call this before writing its contents to this `Hasher`. That way `(collection![1, 2, 3], collection![4, 5])` and `(collection![1, 2], collection![3, 4, 5])` will provide different sequences of values to the `Hasher`

The `impl<T> Hash for [T]` includes a call to this method, so if you’re hashing a slice (or array or vector) via its `Hash::hash` method, you should **not** call this yourself.

This method is only for providing domain separation. If you want to hash a `usize` that represents part of the *data*, then it’s important that you pass it to [`Hasher::write_usize`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html#method.write_usize "method std::hash::Hasher::write_usize") instead of to this method.

##### [§](#examples-3)Examples

```rust
#![feature(hasher_prefixfree_extras)]

use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};
impl<T: Hash> Hash for MyCollection<T> {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
        state.write_length_prefix(self.len());
        for elt in self {
            elt.hash(state);
        }
    }
}
```

##### [§](#note-to-implementers-1)Note to Implementers

If you’ve decided that your `Hasher` is willing to be susceptible to Hash-DoS attacks, then you might consider skipping hashing some or all of the `len` provided in the name of increased performance.

[Source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/src/core/hash/mod.rs.html#550)

🔬This is a nightly-only experimental API. (`hasher_prefixfree_extras` [#96762](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/96762))

Writes a single `str` into this hasher.

If you’re implementing [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html "trait std::hash::Hash"), you generally do not need to call this, as the `impl Hash for str` does, so you should prefer that instead.

This includes the domain separator for prefix-freedom, so you should **not** call `Self::write_length_prefix` before calling this.

##### [§](#note-to-implementers-2)Note to Implementers

There are at least two reasonable default ways to implement this. Which one will be the default is not yet decided, so for now you probably want to override it specifically.

###### [§](#the-general-answer)The general answer

It’s always correct to implement this with a length prefix:

```rust
fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) {
    self.write_length_prefix(s.len());
    self.write(s.as_bytes());
}
```

And, if your `Hasher` works in `usize` chunks, this is likely a very efficient way to do it, as anything more complicated may well end up slower than just running the round with the length.

###### [§](#if-your-hasher-works-byte-wise)If your `Hasher` works byte-wise

One nice thing about `str` being UTF-8 is that the `b'\xFF'` byte never happens. That means that you can append that to the byte stream being hashed and maintain prefix-freedom:

```rust
fn write_str(&mut self, s: &str) {
    self.write(s.as_bytes());
    self.write_u8(0xff);
}
```

This does require that your implementation not add extra padding, and thus generally requires that you maintain a buffer, running a round only once that buffer is full (or `finish` is called).

That’s because if `write` pads data out to a fixed chunk size, it’s likely that it does it in such a way that `"a"` and `"a\x00"` would end up hashing the same sequence of things, introducing conflicts.
