Learn how to view and pay invoices, view your billing history, and verify your billing renewal date. All monthly and annual subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of the subscription term using your default payment method.

For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

The information listed in the "Bill to" section of your invoice is based on your billing information. Not all fields are required. The billing information includes the following:

You can’t make changes to a paid or unpaid billing invoice. When you update your billing information, this change won't update an existing invoice.

If you need to update your billing information, make sure you do so before your subscription renewal date when your invoice is finalized.

If you've selected pay by invoice for your subscription, you'll receive email reminders to pay your invoice at 10 days before the due date, on the due date, and 15 days after the due date.

When your payment has processed, the invoice's **Status** column will update to **Paid** and you will receive a confirmation email.

If you choose to pay using a US bank account, you must verify the account. For more information, see [Verify a bank account](https://docs.docker.com/billing/payment-method/#verify-a-bank-account).

You can view your billing history and download past invoices for a personal account or organization.

You must be an owner of the organization to view the billing history.
