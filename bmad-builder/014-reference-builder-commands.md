Reference for the three core BMad Builder skills: the Agent Builder (`bmad-agent-builder`), the Workflow Builder (`bmad-workflow-builder`), and the Module Builder (`bmad-module-builder`).

## Capabilities Overview

[Section titled “Capabilities Overview”](#capabilities-overview)

CapabilityMenu CodeAgent BuilderWorkflow Builder**Build Process**BPBuild, edit, convert, or fix agentsBuild, edit, convert, or fix workflows and utilities**Quality Optimize**QOValidate and optimize existing agentsValidate and optimize existing workflows and utilities**Convert**CW-Convert any skill to BMad-compliant, outcome-driven equivalent with comparison report

Both capabilities support autonomous/headless mode via `--headless` / `-H` flags.

ContextAgent PatternWorkflow Pattern**Standalone**`agent-{name}``{name}`**Module**`{modulecode}-agent-{name}``{modulecode}-{name}`

Names must be kebab-case and match the folder name. Agents should include `agent` in the name. For module-based skills, the user chooses the module code prefix during the build.

## Build Process (BP)

[Section titled “Build Process (BP)”](#build-process-bp)

The core creative path. Six phases of conversational discovery take you from a rough idea to a complete, tested skill folder.

Both builders accept any of these as a starting point.

InputWhat HappensA rough idea or descriptionGuided discovery from scratchAn existing BMad skill pathEdit mode. Analyze what exists, determine what to changeA non-BMad skill, tool, or codeConvert to BMad-compliant structureDocumentation, API specs, or codeExtract intent and requirements automatically

### Interaction Modes

[Section titled “Interaction Modes”](#interaction-modes)

ModeBehaviorBest For**Guided**The builder walks through decisions, clarifies ambiguities, ensures completenessProduction skills, first-time builders**YOLO**Brain-dump your idea; the builder guesses its way to a finished skill with minimal questionsQuick prototypes, experienced builders**Autonomous**Fully headless; no interactive prompts, proceeds with safe defaultsCI/CD, batch processing, orchestrated builds

### Agent Builder: Phase 1 Agent Type Detection

[Section titled “Agent Builder: Phase 1 Agent Type Detection”](#agent-builder-phase-1-agent-type-detection)

The builder determines the agent type through natural questions, not a menu:

Question (asked naturally)If NoIf YesDoes this agent need to remember between sessions?StatelessMemory or AutonomousShould the user be able to teach it new things?Fixed capabilitiesEvolvable capabilitiesDoes it operate autonomously between sessions?MemoryAutonomous

For memory and autonomous agents, the builder also determines **relationship depth**: deep (calibration-style First Breath with open-ended discovery) or focused (configuration-style First Breath with guided questions).

### Agent Builder: Phase 2 Capabilities Strategy

[Section titled “Agent Builder: Phase 2 Capabilities Strategy”](#agent-builder-phase-2-capabilities-strategy)

Determines the mix of internal and external capabilities, plus script opportunities.

Capability TypeDescription**Internal commands**Prompt-driven actions, each gets a file in `references/`**External skills**Standalone skills the agent invokes by registered name**Scripts**Deterministic operations offloaded from the LLM (validation, data processing, file ops)**Evolvable capabilities**If enabled: user can teach the agent new capabilities over time via authoring reference

### Agent Builder: Phase 3 Requirements

[Section titled “Agent Builder: Phase 3 Requirements”](#agent-builder-phase-3-requirements)

Requirements differ by agent type. Stateless agents need identity and capabilities. Memory and autonomous agents need everything below.

**All agent types:**

RequirementDescription**Identity**Who is this agent? Communication style, decision-making philosophy**Capabilities**Internal commands, external skills, scripts**Folder dominion**Read boundaries, write boundaries, explicit deny zones

**Memory and autonomous agents add:**

RequirementDescription**Identity seed**2-3 sentences of personality DNA for PERSONA.md**Species-level mission**Domain-specific purpose statement for CREED.md**Core values**3-5 values that guide behavior**Standing orders**Surprise-and-delight + self-improvement, adapted to the domain with examples**CREED seeds**Philosophy, boundaries, anti-patterns (behavioral + operational)**BOND territories**Domain-specific areas to learn about the owner**First Breath territories**Discovery questions beyond the universal set

**Autonomous agents add:**

RequirementDescription**PULSE behaviors**Default wake behavior, domain-specific autonomous tasks**Named task routing**Tasks invoked via `--headless {task-name}` or `-H {task-name}`**Frequency & quiet hours**How often to wake, when not to

### Workflow Builder: Phase 2-3 Details

[Section titled “Workflow Builder: Phase 2-3 Details”](#workflow-builder-phase-2-3-details)

**Skill type classification** determines template and structure.

TypeSignalsStructure**Simple Utility**Composable building block, clear input/output, usually mostly script-drivenSingle SKILL.md, scripts folder**Simple Workflow**Fits in one SKILL.md, a few sequential steps, optional autonomousSKILL.md with inline steps, optional prompts and resources**Complex Workflow**Multiple stages, branching prompt flows, progressive disclosure, long-runningSKILL.md for routing, `prompts/` for stage details, `resources/` for reference data

**Workflow-specific requirements** gathered in Phase 3:

RequirementSimple UtilitySimple WorkflowComplex Workflow**Input/output format**Yes--**Composability**Yes--**Steps**-Numbered stepsNamed stages with progression conditions**Headless mode**-OptionalOptional**Config variables**-Core + customCore + module-specific**Module sequencing**OptionalOptionalRecommended

The output structure depends on the agent type.

**Stateless agents:**

```

**Memory and autonomous agents:**

└── scripts/

└── tests/
```

The seed templates contain real content from the discovery phases, not placeholders. The init script is parameterized with the skill name, file lists, and evolvable flag.

**Workflow builder** output remains the same regardless of agent type:

```plaintext

{skill-name}/
├── SKILL.md              # Skill instructions
├── prompts/              # Stage prompts for complex workflows

│   └── tests/            # Unit tests for scripts
└── templates/            # Building blocks for generated output
```

Before completing the build, both builders run deterministic validation.

ScriptWhat It Checks`scan-path-standards.py`Path conventions: no `{skill-root}`, `{project-root}` for project-scope, `./` for skill-internal, no double-prefix`scan-scripts.py`Script portability, PEP 723 metadata, agentic design, unit test presence

Critical issues block completion. Warnings are noted but don’t block.

## Quality Optimize (QO)

[Section titled “Quality Optimize (QO)”](#quality-optimize-qo)

Validation and optimization for existing skills. Runs deterministic lint scripts for instant structural checks and LLM scanner subagents for judgment-based analysis, all in parallel.

In interactive mode, the optimizer:

1. Checks for uncommitted changes and recommends committing first
2. Asks if the skill is currently working as expected

In autonomous mode, both checks are skipped and noted as warnings in the report.

The optimizer runs three tiers of analysis.

**Tier 1: Lint scripts** (deterministic, zero tokens, instant):

ScriptFocus`scan-path-standards.py`Path convention violations`scan-scripts.py`Script portability and standards

**Tier 2: Pre-pass scripts** (extract metrics for LLM scanners):

ScriptAgent BuilderWorkflow BuilderStructure/integrity pre-pass`prepass-structure-capabilities.py``prepass-workflow-integrity.py`Prompt metrics pre-pass`prepass-prompt-metrics.py``prepass-prompt-metrics.py`Execution dependency pre-pass`prepass-execution-deps.py``prepass-execution-deps.py`

**Tier 3: LLM scanners** (judgment-based, run as parallel subagents):

ScannerAgent Builder FocusWorkflow Builder Focus**Structure / Integrity**Structure, capabilities, identity, memory setup, consistencyLogical consistency, description quality, progression conditions, type-appropriate structure**Prompt Craft**Token efficiency, anti-patterns, persona voice, overview qualityToken efficiency, anti-patterns, overview quality, progressive disclosure**Execution Efficiency**Parallelization, subagent delegation, memory loading, context optimizationParallelization, subagent delegation, read avoidance, context optimization**Cohesion**Persona-capability alignment, gaps, redundanciesStage flow coherence, purpose alignment, complexity appropriateness**Enhancement Opportunities**Script automation, autonomous potential, edge cases, delightCreative edge-case discovery, experience gaps, assumption auditing

After all scanners complete, the optimizer synthesizes results into a unified report saved to `{bmad_builder_reports}/{skill-name}/quality-scan/{timestamp}/`.

In interactive mode, it presents a summary with severity counts and offers next steps:

- Apply fixes directly
- Export checklist for manual fixes
- Discuss specific findings

In autonomous mode, it outputs structured JSON with severity counts and the report file path.

### Optimization Guidance

[Section titled “Optimization Guidance”](#optimization-guidance)

Not every suggestion should be applied. The optimizer communicates these decision rules:

- **Keep phrasing** that captures the intended voice. Leaner is not always better for persona-driven skills
- **Keep content** that adds clarity for the AI even if a human finds it obvious
- **Prefer scripting** for deterministic operations; **prefer prompting** for creative or judgment-based tasks
- **Reject changes** that flatten personality unless a neutral tone is explicitly wanted

One-command conversion of any existing skill into a BMad-compliant, outcome-driven equivalent. Takes a non-conformant skill (bloated, poorly structured, or just not following BMad practices) and produces a clean version. Unlike the Build Process’s edit/rebuild modes, `--convert` always runs headless and produces a visual comparison report.

```plaintext

--convert <path-or-url> [-H]
```

The `--convert` flag implies headless mode. Accepts a local skill path or a URL (not limited to remote; local file paths work too).

StepWhat Happens**1. Capture**Fetch or read the original skill, save a copy for comparison**2. Rebuild**Full headless rebuild from intent: extract what the skill achieves, apply BMad outcome-driven best practices**3. Report**Measure both versions, categorize what changed and why, generate an interactive HTML comparison report

### Comparison Report

[Section titled “Comparison Report”](#comparison-report)

The HTML report includes:

SectionContent**Hero banner**Overall token reduction percentage**Metrics table**Lines, words, characters, sections, files, estimated tokens, with visual bars**What changed**Categorized differences (bloat removal, structural reorganization, best-practice alignment) with severity and examples**What survived**Content that earns its place: instructions the LLM wouldn’t follow correctly without being told**Verdict**One-sentence summary of the conversion

Reports are saved to `{bmad_builder_reports}/convert-{skill-name}/`.

### When to Use Convert vs Build Process

[Section titled “When to Use Convert vs Build Process”](#when-to-use-convert-vs-build-process)

The Module Builder (`bmad-module-builder`) handles module-level planning, scaffolding, and validation. It operates at a higher level than the Agent and Workflow Builders; it orchestrates what those builders produce into a cohesive, installable module.

### Capabilities Overview

[Section titled “Capabilities Overview”](#capabilities-overview-1)

CapabilityMenu CodeWhat It Does**Ideate Module**IMBrainstorm and plan a module through creative facilitation**Create Module**CMPackage skills as an installable module: setup skill for multi-skill, self-registration for standalone**Validate Module**VMCheck structural integrity and entry quality for both multi-skill and standalone modules

### Ideate Module (IM)

[Section titled “Ideate Module (IM)”](#ideate-module-im)

A brainstorming session that helps you plan your module from scratch. The builder acts as a creative collaborator, drawing out ideas, exploring possibilities, and guiding you toward the right architecture.

AspectDetail**Interaction**Interactive only; no headless mode**Input**An idea or rough description**Output**Plan document saved to `{bmad_builder_reports}`

**What it covers:**

- Problem space exploration and creative brainstorming
- Architecture decision: single agent with capabilities vs. multiple skills vs. hybrid
- Standalone module or expansion of an existing module
- External dependencies (CLI tools, MCP servers)
- UI and visualization opportunities
- Setup skill extensions beyond configuration
- Per-skill capability definitions with help CSV metadata
- Configuration variables and sensible defaults

The plan document uses a resumable template with YAML frontmatter, so long brainstorming sessions survive context compaction.

**After ideation:** Build each planned skill using the Agent Builder (BA) or Workflow Builder (BW), then return to Create Module (CM) to scaffold the module.

### Create Module (CM)

[Section titled “Create Module (CM)”](#create-module-cm)

Packages built skills as an installable BMad module. Auto-detects single-skill vs. multi-skill input and recommends the appropriate approach. Supports `--headless` / `-H`.

AspectDetail**Interaction**Guided or headless**Input**Path to a skills folder or single skill (or SKILL.md file), optional plan document**Output**Setup skill for multi-skill modules, or self-registration files for standalone modules

**What it does:**

1. Reads the SKILL.md files to understand each skill
2. Detects single vs. multi-skill and confirms the packaging approach with the user
3. Collects module identity (name, code, description, version, greeting)
4. Defines help CSV entries: capabilities, menu codes, ordering, relationships
5. Captures configuration variables and external dependencies
6. Scaffolds the module infrastructure

**Multi-skill output:** A dedicated `{code}-setup/` folder with merge scripts, cleanup scripts, and a generic SKILL.md.

**Standalone output:** `assets/module-setup.md`, `assets/module.yaml`, and `assets/module-help.csv` embedded in the skill, plus merge scripts in `scripts/` and a `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for distribution. The skill’s SKILL.md is updated to check for registration on activation.

### Validate Module (VM)

[Section titled “Validate Module (VM)”](#validate-module-vm)

Verifies that a module’s structure is complete and accurate. Auto-detects multi-skill modules (with setup skill) and standalone modules (with self-registration). Combines a deterministic validation script with LLM-based quality assessment.

AspectDetail**Interaction**Interactive**Input**Path to the module’s skills folder or single skill**Output**Validation report

**Structural checks** (script-driven):

CheckWhat It CatchesModule structureMissing setup skill or standalone files (`module-setup.md`, merge scripts)CoverageSkills without CSV entries, orphan entries for nonexistent skillsMenu codesDuplicate codes across the moduleReferencesBefore/after fields pointing to nonexistent capabilitiesRequired fieldsMissing skill name, display name, menu code, or description in CSV rowsmodule.yamlMissing code, name, or description

**Quality assessment** (LLM-driven):

- Description accuracy: does each entry match what the skill actually does?
- Description quality: concise, action-oriented, specific, not overly verbose
- Completeness: are all distinct capabilities registered as separate rows?
- Ordering: do before/after relationships make sense?
- Menu codes: are they intuitive and memorable?
