# Matrix (Synapse)

## What is Matrix?

Matrix is an open-source, decentralized communication protocol that enables secure, real-time communication. It provides end-to-end encrypted messaging, voice and video calls, file sharing, and room-based conversations. Matrix serves as an excellent alternative to proprietary platforms like Slack or Discord, offering federation capabilities that allow different Matrix servers to communicate with each other.

## What is Synapse?

Synapse is a [Matrix homeserver](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/servers/) written in Python/Twisted, [developed and maintained](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse) by the team [Element](https://element.io/), creators of Matrix.

## Deployment Variants

Synapse Matrix server is available in two deployment configurations in Coolify:

### Synapse with SQlite

* **Database:** SQLite (embedded)
* **Use case:** Simple deployments, testing, or personal Matrix hosting
* **Components:** Single Synapse container with built-in SQLite database

### Synapse with PostgreSQL (recommended)

* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Use case:** Production deployments requiring better performance and scalability
* **Components:**
  * Synapse container
  * PostgreSQL container
  * Automatic database configuration and health checks

## Installation Steps

For all deployment variants the installation steps are the same.

### Matrix domain setup (important)

Matrix uses a value called the **server name** to generate user IDs and room
aliases.

* Server name `example.org` results in:
  * `@user:example.org`
  * `#room:example.org`

The Matrix server itself can run on a different domain, for example
`matrix.example.org`.

### Recommended setup

* Matrix server name: `example.org`
* Matrix Synapse server service domain: `matrix.example.org`

This allows users and rooms to use `:example.org` while hosting Synapse on a
subdomain.

### Coolify configuration

#### Domains

In the service configuration, set the domain to `matrix.example.org:8008`

#### Environment variables

Set the following environment variable:

* `SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME=example.org`

### Delegation (required)

Because Synapse runs on `matrix.example.org` but identifies as `example.org`,
[delegation](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/delegate.html) is required.

On `https://example.org`, serve the following files:

* `/.well-known/matrix/client` for server delegation

```json
{
  "m.homeserver": {
    "base_url": "https://matrix.example.org"
  }
}
```

* `/.well-known/matrix/server` for Federation discovery

```json
{
  "m.server": "matrix.example.org:443"
}
```
