The `overlay` network driver creates a distributed network among multiple Docker daemon hosts. This network sits on top of (overlays) the host-specific networks, allowing containers connected to it to communicate securely when encryption is enabled. Docker transparently handles routing of each packet to and from the correct Docker daemon host and the correct destination container.

You can create user-defined `overlay` networks using `docker network create`, in the same way that you can create user-defined `bridge` networks. Services or containers can be connected to more than one network at a time. Services or containers can only communicate across networks they're each connected to.

Overlay networks are often used to create a connection between Swarm services, but you can also use it to connect standalone containers running on different hosts. When using standalone containers, it's still required that you use Swarm mode to establish a connection between the hosts.

This page describes overlay networks in general, and when used with standalone containers. For information about overlay for Swarm services, see [Manage Swarm service networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/networking/).

Docker hosts must be part of a swarm to use overlay networks, even when connecting standalone containers. The following ports must be open between participating hosts:

- `2377/tcp`: Swarm control plane (configurable)
- `4789/udp`: Overlay traffic (configurable)
- `7946/tcp` and `7946/udp`: Node communication (not configurable)

The following table lists the ports that need to be open to each host participating in an overlay network:

To create an overlay network that containers on other Docker hosts can connect to, run the following command:

The `--attachable` option enables both standalone containers and Swarm services to connect to the overlay network. Without `--attachable`, only Swarm services can connect to the network.

You can specify the IP address range, subnet, gateway, and other options. See `docker network create --help` for details.

Use the `--opt encrypted` flag to encrypt the application data transmitted over the overlay network:

This enables IPsec encryption at the level of the Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN). This encryption imposes a non-negligible performance penalty, so you should test this option before using it in production.

> Don't attach Windows containers to encrypted overlay networks.
> 
> Overlay network encryption isn't supported on Windows. Swarm doesn't report an error when a Windows host attempts to connect to an encrypted overlay network, but networking for the Windows containers is affected as follows:
> 
> - Windows containers can't communicate with Linux containers on the network
> - Data traffic between Windows containers on the network isn't encrypted

Adding containers to an overlay network gives them the ability to communicate with other containers without having to set up routing on the individual Docker daemon hosts. A prerequisite for doing this is that the hosts have joined the same Swarm.

To join an overlay network named `multi-host-network` with a `busybox` container:

> This only works if the overlay network is attachable (created with the `--attachable` flag).

Publishing ports of a container on an overlay network opens the ports to other containers on the same network. Containers are discoverable by doing a DNS lookup using the container name.

Flag valueDescription`-p 8080:80`Map TCP port 80 in the container to port `8080` on the overlay network.`-p 8080:80/udp`Map UDP port 80 in the container to port `8080` on the overlay network.`-p 8080:80/sctp`Map SCTP port 80 in the container to port `8080` on the overlay network.`-p 8080:80/tcp -p 8080:80/udp`Map TCP port 80 in the container to TCP port `8080` on the overlay network, and map UDP port 80 in the container to UDP port `8080` on the overlay network.

Due to limitations set by the Linux kernel, overlay networks become unstable and inter-container communications may break when 1000 containers are co-located on the same host.

For more information about this limitation, see [moby/moby#44973](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/44973#issuecomment-1543747718).

This section provides hands-on examples for working with overlay networks. These examples cover swarm services and standalone containers on multiple Docker hosts.

### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

All examples require at least a single-node swarm. Initialize one by running `docker swarm init` on the host. You can run these examples on multi-node swarms as well.

### [Use the default overlay network](#use-the-default-overlay-network)

This example shows how the default overlay network works with swarm services. You'll create an `nginx` service and examine the network from the service containers' perspective.

#### [Prerequisites for multi-node setup](#prerequisites-for-multi-node-setup)

This walkthrough requires three Docker hosts that can communicate with each other on the same network with no firewall blocking traffic between them:

- `manager`: Functions as both manager and worker
- `worker-1`: Functions as worker only
- `worker-2`: Functions as worker only

If you don't have three hosts available, you can set up three virtual machines on a cloud provider with Docker installed.

#### [Create the swarm](#create-the-swarm)

1. On `manager`, initialize the swarm. If the host has one network interface, the `--advertise-addr` flag is optional:
   
   Save the join token displayed for use with workers.
2. On `worker-1`, join the swarm:
3. On `worker-2`, join the swarm:
4. On `manager`, list all nodes:
   
   Filter by role if needed:
5. List Docker networks on all hosts. Each now has an overlay network called `ingress` and a bridge network called `docker_gwbridge`:

The `docker_gwbridge` connects the `ingress` network to the Docker host's network interface. If you create services without specifying a network, they connect to `ingress`. It's recommended to use separate overlay networks for each application or group of related applications.

#### [Create the services](#create-the-services)

1. On `manager`, create a new overlay network:
   
   The overlay network is automatically created on worker nodes when they run service tasks that need it.
2. On `manager`, create a 5-replica Nginx service connected to `nginx-net`:
   
   > Services can only be created on a manager.
   
   The default `ingress` publish mode means you can browse to port 80 on any node and connect to one of the 5 service tasks, even if no tasks run on that node.
3. Monitor service creation progress:
4. Inspect the `nginx-net` network on all hosts. The `Containers` section lists all service tasks connected to the overlay network from that host.
5. From `manager`, inspect the service:
   
   Notice the information about ports and endpoints.
6. Create a second network and update the service to use it:
7. Verify the update completed:
   
   Inspect both networks to verify containers moved from `nginx-net` to `nginx-net-2`.
   
   > Overlay networks are automatically created on swarm worker nodes as needed, but aren't automatically removed.
8. Clean up:

### [Use a user-defined overlay network](#use-a-user-defined-overlay-network)

This example shows the recommended approach for production services using custom overlay networks.

#### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-1)

This assumes the swarm is already set up and you're on a manager node.

#### [Steps](#steps)

1. Create a user-defined overlay network:
2. Start a service using the overlay network, publishing port 80 to port 8080:
3. Verify the service task is connected to the network:
   
   Check the `Containers` section for the `my-nginx` service task.
4. Clean up:

### [Use an overlay network for standalone containers](#use-an-overlay-network-for-standalone-containers)

This example demonstrates DNS container discovery between standalone containers on different Docker hosts using an overlay network.

#### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-2)

You need two Docker hosts that can communicate with each other with the following ports open between them:

- TCP port 2377
- TCP and UDP port 7946
- UDP port 4789

This example refers to the hosts as `host1` and `host2`.

#### [Steps](#steps-1)

1. Set up the swarm:
   
   On `host1`, initialize a swarm:
   
   On `host2`, join the swarm using the token from the previous output:
   
   If the join fails, run `docker swarm leave --force` on `host2`, verify network and firewall settings, and try again.
2. On `host1`, create an attachable overlay network:
   
   Note the returned network ID.
3. On `host1`, start an interactive container that connects to `test-net`:
4. On `host2`, list available networks. Notice that `test-net` doesn't exist yet:
5. On `host2`, start a detached, interactive container that connects to `test-net`:
   
   > Automatic DNS container discovery only works with unique container names.
6. On `host2`, verify that `test-net` was created with the same network ID as on `host1`:
7. On `host1`, ping `alpine2` from within `alpine1`:
   
   The two containers communicate over the overlay network connecting the two hosts. You can also run another container on `host2` and ping `alpine1`:
8. On `host1`, close the `alpine1` session (which stops the container):
9. Clean up. You must stop and remove containers on each host independently:
   
   On `host2`:
   
   When you stop `alpine2`, `test-net` disappears from `host2`.
   
   On `host1`:
