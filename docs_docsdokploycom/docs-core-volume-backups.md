Learn how to backup your volumes using Dokploy's Volume Backups feature

Volume backups are essential when your service doesn't fit the traditional database backup solutions. This is common when your application uses SQLite databases or doesn't have a database at all, making Dokploy's dedicated database backup features (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.) unsuitable for your use case.

Volume backups allow you to backup [Docker named volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) to S3 destinations, providing a comprehensive backup solution for any type of data stored in volumes.

**Important:** Volume Backups only work with Docker named volumes, not with bind mounts (like the `../files` folder). If you're currently using bind mounts and need backup functionality, you'll need to migrate to named volumes. See the [Docker Compose guide](https://docs.dokploy.com/docs/core/docker-compose#volumes) for a comparison of both methods and guidance on choosing the right approach for your needs.

Volume backups are available for:

1. **Applications** - Single container applications
2. **Docker Compose** - Multi-container applications

Volume Backups require Docker named volumes. If you're using bind mounts (like `../files`), you'll need to switch to named volumes to use this feature.

### [For Applications](#for-applications)

1. Navigate to your application
2. Go to **Advanced** → **Mounts**
3. Create a new mount and select **Volume Mount** option

### [For Docker Compose](#for-docker-compose)

Define named volumes directly in your `docker-compose.yml` file. **Note:** Bind mounts (e.g., `../files/my-data:/app/data`) cannot be backed up using Volume Backups—you must use named volumes:

```
services:
  app:
    image: dokploy/dokploy:latest
    volumes:
      - my-volume:/app/data

volumes:
  my-volume:
```

For more information on choosing between bind mounts and named volumes, see the [Docker Compose volumes section](https://docs.dokploy.com/docs/core/docker-compose#volumes).

Let's walk through a common scenario using N8N, which runs on SQLite and stores data in Docker volumes.

### [N8N Docker Compose Configuration](#n8n-docker-compose-configuration)

```
version: "3.8"
services:
  n8n:
    image: docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n:1.83.2
    restart: always
    environment:
      - N8N_HOST=${N8N_HOST}
      - N8N_PORT=${N8N_PORT}
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=http
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - WEBHOOK_URL=https://${N8N_HOST}/
      - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=${GENERIC_TIMEZONE}
      - N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=false
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n

volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

Since N8N uses SQLite (stored in the `n8n_data` volume), we can't use Dokploy's database backup features. Instead, we'll backup the entire volume.

### [Backup Configuration](#backup-configuration)

1. Deploy your N8N template
2. Navigate to **Volume Backups** section
3. Create a new volume backup with these settings:

SettingValueDescription**Name**`my-n8n-backup`Unique identifier for your backup**Schedule**`0 0 * * *`Daily backup at midnight (cron format)**Destination**Your S3 destinationMust be configured in your account**Service Name**`n8n`Auto-complete will suggest available services**Volume Name**`n8n_data`Auto-filled when service is selected**Backup Prefix**OptionalAdditional prefix for backup files**Turn off Container**OptionalSee safety considerations below**Enabled**✓Enable the backup schedule

### [Safety Considerations](#safety-considerations)

**Turn off Container during backup** option provides two approaches:

- **Container OFF** (Recommended): Safer option that prevents data corruption during backup, this will stop the container during the backup, and then start it again after the backup is done.
- **Container ON**: Faster but may cause inconsistencies if the service is actively writing to the volume

When backing up with the container running, there's a risk of data corruption if the application is actively writing to the volume during backup.

### [Restore Process](#restore-process)

1. Navigate to **Volume Backups** section
2. Select **Restore Volume** option
3. Choose your S3 destination where the backup is stored
4. Select the specific backup you want to restore
5. Enter the target volume name for restoration

### [Volume Naming for Docker Compose](#volume-naming-for-docker-compose)

For Docker Compose services, volume names follow a specific pattern: `{appName}_{volumeName}`

**Example**: If your app name is `n8n-n8n-kqlble`, the volume name would be: `n8n-n8n-kqlble_n8n_data`

### [Important Restore Considerations](#important-restore-considerations)

**Before restoring:**

- Ensure the target volume doesn't already exist
- Stop any containers using the volume
- Remove the existing volume if necessary

The restore will fail if the volume is in use or already exists.

### [Finding the Correct Volume Name](#finding-the-correct-volume-name)

1. **Check your Docker Compose file** to understand the volume structure
2. **Verify the app name** in Dokploy (usually under the name of your service)
3. **Use the pattern**: `{appName}_{volumeName}` for Docker Compose services
4. **For single applications**: Volume names are typically simpler and match your mount configuration

This ensures your restored volume will be properly recognized and used by your Docker Compose services when they restart.
