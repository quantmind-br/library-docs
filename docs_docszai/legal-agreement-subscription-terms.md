# Subscriptions, Fees, and Payment

## 1. Fees and Billing

* Access to certain Z.ai services or features may require payment. Applicable fees are listed on the **Z.ai**, unless otherwise communicated in writing.
* To purchase services, you must provide complete and accurate billing information (“Payment Method”). You authorize us to charge your Payment Method for the applicable fees and any taxes.
* If you subscribe through a third-party distributor (e.g., an app store), your payment, billing, and refund terms are governed by the distributor’s policies.
* Except where required by law or explicitly stated, all payments are **non-refundable**. Please review your order carefully before confirming.

## 2. Subscriptions and Renewal

* Some services are available by subscription (“Subscription”). The scope, features, and duration of your Subscription will be described during checkout. Z.ai may update the content or features from time to time.
* Paid Subscriptions **renew automatically** at the end of each subscription term, and your Payment Method will be charged for the renewal term, unless you cancel.
* If your Subscription has an initial minimum term (“Initial Term”), it will automatically renew for the same duration (“Renewal Term”) unless canceled.
* You may cancel your Subscription at any time using the tools provided by Z.ai. If purchased through a distributor, cancellation must follow the distributor’s process.
* To avoid renewal charges, cancel at least **24 hours before the end of the current term**. Cancellation does not entitle you to a refund, but you will continue to have access until the end of the paid term.

## 3. Fee Changes

* Z.ai may adjust Subscription fees from time to time but will not increase fees during your current term.
* If fees are increased, you will be notified in advance. Continuing the Subscription after renewal constitutes acceptance of the new fees.

## 4. Usage Rules

1. **Basic rules**

* During your use, you should comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and industry standards. You shall not use the subscription service for any unlawful purposes, nor for engaging in any activities that are contrary to public policy and morals or infringe upon the rights and interests of others.
* You shall comply with Terms of Use, Service Agreements, usage rules and other relevant agreementsf [Z.ai](http://Z.ai).
* Violation of this agreement may result in the suspension or termination of services, and paid fees will not be refunded.

2. **Usage Scenario Restrictions**

* You understand and agree that the GLM Coding Plan is a subscription service designed for developers’ code-assistance scenarios. The usage quota under this plan may only be used within coding/IDE tools designated or recognized by [Z.ai](http://Z.ai) (including but not limited to Claude Code, Kilo Code, and any other tools as may be announced or updated by [Z.ai](http://Z.ai) from time to time).
* You shall not use the GLM Coding Plan quota for general-purpose API access or any scenarios outside such tools, including but not limited to directly invoking model APIs from your own applications, bots, websites, SaaS products or other systems, unless you have entered into a separate written agreement with [Z.ai](http://Z.ai).
* Unless otherwise agreed in writing, you may not resell, sub-resell, repackage, aggregate, proxy or otherwise provide the GLM Coding Plan to any third party, whether on a paid or free basis, nor may you use the GLM Coding Plan to provide model capabilities as a service to third parties.

3. **Personal-Use Only**

* The GLM Coding Plan subscription is tied to a single account and is licensed only to the individual natural person associated with such account.
* You shall not share your account or subscription, or allow any other person (including but not limited to your colleagues, friends, customers or any organization) to use your GLM Coding Plan quota, whether by sharing credentials, renting, lending, transferring, sublicensing or by any other means.
* If [Z.ai](http://Z.ai) reasonably suspects that you are engaging in account sharing, bulk or automated usage on behalf of others, resale of access, or any other conduct that may harm the platform’s fair-use order or the legitimate rights and interests of third parties, [Z.ai](http://Z.ai) is entitled to take measures including, without limitation, restricting certain features, reducing or limiting your usage quota, suspending or terminating the service, reclaiming any remaining quota, and pursuing further liability in accordance with this Agreement and applicable laws.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

* Z.ai shall exert reasonable efforts to ensure the stability and security of the subscription service. However, Z.ai **does not warrant** that the service will be entirely error-free or meet your expectations. Z.ai **shall not be liable** for service interruptions caused by **force majeure**, network failures, or third-party actions.

## 6. Other Terms

* Additional services or features may require separate fees, which you will have the chance to review and accept before being charged.
* Z.ai is not liable for errors or issues caused by third-party payment processors.
