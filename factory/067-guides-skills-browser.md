The browser skill bundles a handful of executable scripts (`start.js`, `nav.js`, `eval.js`, `screenshot.js`, `pick.js`) plus a concise `SKILL.md`. Together they give Factory Droids a reliable way to spin up Chrome on port `9222`, drive an existing tab, scrape structured data, and capture visual evidence while staying entirely on the developer machine.

## When to use this skill

- You need **real-browser context** (authenticated sessions, production-only behavior, visual regressions) to complete a task.
- You want to **inspect or extract DOM state** without building a dedicated MCP server.
- You must **capture screenshots or DOM element metadata** as part of QA notes, bug triage, or documentation.
- You prefer a **portable, git-tracked bundle** that any teammate can run locally with zero additional infrastructure.

## What the scripts provide

ScriptPurposeTypical usage`start.js`Launches Chrome with remote debugging on `:9222`, with optional profile sync via `--profile`.`~/.factory/skills/browser/start.js --profile``nav.js`Navigates the active tab or opens a new tab when `--new` is passed.`~/.factory/skills/browser/nav.js https://example.com --new``eval.js`Runs arbitrary JavaScript (async supported) in the focused tab and prints structured results.`~/.factory/skills/browser/eval.js "document.title"``screenshot.js`Captures the current viewport to a timestamped PNG stored under `$TMPDIR`.`~/.factory/skills/browser/screenshot.js``pick.js`Injects a visual picker so you can click DOM nodes and return tag/id/class/text metadata.`~/.factory/skills/browser/pick.js "Click the submit button"`

All scripts rely on `puppeteer-core` and connect to a Chrome instance that you control. Because everything runs locally, existing cookies and auth tokens never leave your machine.

## Setup

## Skill definition

Copy the following into `.factory/skills/browser/SKILL.md`:

description: Minimal Chrome DevTools Protocol tools for browser automation and scraping. Use when you need to start Chrome, navigate pages, execute JavaScript, take screenshots, or interactively pick DOM elements.

# Browser Tools

Minimal CDP tools for collaborative site exploration and scraping.

**IMPORTANT**: All scripts are located in `~/.factory/skills/browser/` and must be called with full paths.

## Start Chrome

```bash
~/.factory/skills/browser/start.js              # Fresh profile
~/.factory/skills/browser/start.js --profile    # Copy your profile (cookies, logins)
```

Start Chrome on `:9222` with remote debugging.

## Navigate

```bash
~/.factory/skills/browser/nav.js https://example.com
~/.factory/skills/browser/nav.js https://example.com --new
```

Navigate current tab or open new tab.

## Evaluate JavaScript

```bash
~/.factory/skills/browser/eval.js 'document.title'
~/.factory/skills/browser/eval.js 'document.querySelectorAll("a").length'
```

Execute JavaScript in active tab (async context).

**IMPORTANT**: The code must be a single expression or use IIFE for multiple statements:

- Single expression: `'document.title'`
- Multiple statements: `'(() => { const x = 1; return x + 1; })()'`
- Avoid newlines in the code string - keep it on one line

## Screenshot

```bash
~/.factory/skills/browser/screenshot.js
```

Screenshot current viewport, returns temp file path.

## Pick Elements

```bash
~/.factory/skills/browser/pick.js "Click the submit button"
```

Interactive element picker. Click to select, Cmd/Ctrl+Click for multi-select, Enter to finish.

## Usage Notes

- Start Chrome first before using other tools
- The `--profile` flag syncs your actual Chrome profile so you're logged in everywhere
- JavaScript evaluation runs in an async context in the page
- Pick tool allows you to visually select DOM elements by clicking on them

```

## Workflow recipe

1. **Start Chrome** with `start.js --profile` to mirror your authenticated state.
2. **Drive navigation** via `nav.js https://target.app` or open secondary tabs with `--new`.
3. **Inspect the DOM** using `eval.js` for quick counts, attribute checks, or extracting JSON payloads.
4. **Capture artifacts** with `screenshot.js` for visual proof or `pick.js` when you need precise selectors or text snapshots.
5. **Return the gathered evidence** (file paths, DOM metadata, query outputs) in your session summary or PR description.

This workflow keeps the agent focused on the current browsing context and avoids shipping raw credentials or cookies outside your machine.

## Verification

- `~/.factory/skills/browser/start.js --profile` should print `✓ Chrome started on :9222 with your profile`.
- `~/.factory/skills/browser/nav.js https://example.com` should confirm navigation.
- `~/.factory/skills/browser/eval.js 'document.title'` should echo the current page title.
- `~/.factory/skills/browser/screenshot.js` should output a valid PNG path under your system temp directory.

If any step fails, rerun `start.js`, confirm Chrome is listening on `localhost:9222/json/version`, and ensure `puppeteer-core` is installed.
