summary: This document outlines the identity and access management framework for Droids, explaining how user identities, roles, and runtime environments determine permissions and policy enforcement. It details the interaction between organizational hierarchies, SSO integration, and role-based access control for managing secure agent execution.

# Identity & Access Management

> How Droids use org, project, and user identity to control who can run agents, where, and with which permissions.

Identity and access management controls **who can run Droid**, in which environments, and under what policies.

This page provides an overview of the identity model, roles, and environments; detailed SSO and SCIM setup instructions live in [SSO, IdP & SCIM Provisioning](/enterprise/identity-sso-and-scim).

***

## Identity model

Every Droid run is associated with three dimensions of identity:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="User or machine identity" icon="user">
    Human developers authenticate via SSO (SAML/OIDC), inheriting their
    directory groups and roles. Automation (CI/CD, scheduled jobs) runs under
    **machine identities** with long‑lived tokens or workload identities.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Org / project / folder" icon="folders">
    The active repo and `.factory/` folders determine the **org, project, and
    folder context**. Policies at these levels decide which models, tools, and
    integrations Droid may use.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Runtime environment" icon="server">
    Whether Droid is running on a laptop, in a CI runner, or in a sandboxed
    VM/devcontainer is captured as environment attributes. Policies can treat
    these differently (for example, higher autonomy only in CI or sandboxes).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Session metadata" icon="activity">
    Each Droid session records metadata such as session ID, CLI version, and git
    branch, which is available for audit and OTEL telemetry.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Org identity and SSO (overview)

Most enterprises integrate Factory with an identity provider (IdP) such as **Okta, Azure AD, or Google Workspace**.

At a high level:

* **Org membership** is derived from IdP groups mapped to Factory organizations and teams.
* **SSO sign‑in** gives developers access to both the web platform and Droid using corporate credentials.
* **Role information** (for example, `Owner`, `Admin`, `User`) flows from IdP groups into Factory roles.

For step‑by‑step SSO and SCIM configuration—including setting up the IdP application, mapping attributes, and enabling provisioning—see [SSO, IdP & SCIM Provisioning](/enterprise/identity-sso-and-scim).

## Role‑based access control (RBAC)

Factory distinguishes between three broad classes of actors:

* **Org administrators**

  * Define org‑level `.factory` configuration, including model policies, global command allow/deny lists, and default telemetry targets.
  * Decide which deployment patterns (cloud, hybrid, airgapped) are supported and where Droid binaries may run.
  * Configure security features such as maximum autonomy level and whether user‑supplied BYOK keys are allowed.

* **Project owners / maintainers**

  * Own project‑level `.factory/` folders that live in version control.
  * Provide team‑specific models, droids, commands, and hooks that extend org policy without weakening it.
  * Configure project‑specific policies, for example limiting Droid to certain repositories or directories.

* **Developers**
  * Customize personal preferences in `~/.factory/` (for example, default model choice within the allowed set).
  * Run Droid locally, in IDEs, or via team‑provided scripts and CI jobs.
  * Cannot override any setting defined at org or project level.

Role assignment flows from your IdP into Factory; the **hierarchical settings engine** enforces what each role can effectively change. See [Hierarchical Settings & Org Control](/enterprise/hierarchical-settings-and-org-control) for the exact precedence rules.

## Devices, environments, and workspace trust

Because Droid is a CLI, it can run in many environments:

* Developer laptops (macOS, Linux, Windows)
* Remote dev servers or workspaces
* CI runners and build agents
* Hardened VMs and devcontainers

Enterprise customers typically combine Droid with **endpoint management** and **workspace trust** controls:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Endpoint & MDM controls">
    Use tools like **Jamf, Intune, or other MDM solutions** to control where Droid binaries can be installed, which users can run them, and which configuration files they can read.

    Common patterns include:

    * Only allowing Droid to run under managed user accounts.
    * Restricting configuration directories to corporate‑managed volumes.
    * Enforcing OS‑level disk encryption and screen lock policies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Workspace trust">
    Treat Droid as trusted only in **known repositories and environments**:

    * Pin Droid to specific paths or repos on developer machines.
    * Require elevated approval or sandboxed environments for untrusted code.
    * Use project‑level `.factory/` folders to mark which repos are "Droid‑ready" and what policies should apply.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment‑aware policies">
    The same developer may run Droid in multiple contexts: on their laptop, in CI, or in an isolated container.

    Policies can take these differences into account:

    * Allow higher autonomy or more powerful tools **only** inside devcontainers or CI runners.
    * Restrict network access or command execution when running on laptops.
    * Tag OTEL telemetry with environment attributes to support environment‑specific alerting.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How identity flows into policy and telemetry

Identity and environment information are used in two main ways:

1. **Policy evaluation** – hierarchical settings (org → project → folder → user) use identity to determine which configuration bundle applies to a given run.
2. **Telemetry and audit** – Droid emits OTEL metrics, traces, and logs with attributes like `user.id`, `team.id`, `session.id`, and environment tags so you can build per‑org and per‑team dashboards.

For details on how these identities are encoded in telemetry, see [Compliance, Audit & Monitoring](/enterprise/compliance-audit-and-monitoring).
