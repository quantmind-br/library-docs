## Groups - view all student groups

Allows user to view the group home pages of all student groups.

Allows students to access other student groups within a group set with a direct link.

### Additional Considerations

By default students are able to create groups; to restrict students from creating groups, do not select the Let students organize their own groups checkbox in Course Settings.
