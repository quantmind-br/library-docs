I've retrieved the transcript for Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video. The transcript shows the lyrics of the song, though there are some minor transcription errors due to the automated nature of the system. The transcript includes the iconic chorus and verses of this famous 1987 song, which has become one of the most well-known internet memes, often used for "rickrolling."

Would you like me to help you with anything else regarding the video or its transcript?
