## [AJAX](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.1/guides/javascript/ajax)

The preferred way to write new ajax interactions in Moodle is to use the JavaScript module core/ajax which directly calls web service functions built using the Moodle Web Service API.

## [Combobox searching](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.1/guides/javascript/comboboxsearch)

A combobox search component has been added to the core Moodle system. This component provides an additional layer of search functionality, allowing users to easily navigate and filter search results. The combobox search component is designed to be reusable and can be integrated into various areas of the Moodle platform.
