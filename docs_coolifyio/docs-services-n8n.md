## What is N8N?

N8N is an open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different applications and services together. It is an open-source alternative to tools like Zapier or Make.

## Deployment Variants

N8N is available in three deployment configurations in Coolify:

### n8n (Default)

* **Database:** SQLite (embedded)
* **Use case:** Simple deployments, testing, or low-volume workflows
* **Components:** Single n8n container with built-in SQLite database

### n8n with PostgreSQL

* **Database:** PostgreSQL (external)
* **Use case:** Production deployments requiring better performance, scalability, and data persistence
* **Components:**
  * n8n container
  * PostgreSQL 16 container
  * Automatic database configuration and health checks

### n8n with PostgreSQL and Worker

* **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis
* **Use case:** High-volume production deployments with queue-based execution and parallel workflow processing
* **Components:**
  * n8n main container
  * n8n-worker container for distributed execution

### Extending n8n with custom dependencies

To extend n8n with custom dependencies, you can add them following the example below to your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
...
RUN apk add --no-cache ffmpeg
...
```

### Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM n8nio/n8n:latest

# Switch to root user to install packages and modify system directories
USER root

# Install necessary system packages using apk
# build-base, python3-dev, geoip-dev are needed for potential native dependencies
# wget for downloading, git for source control (might be needed by Go), bash (useful shell)
RUN apk update && \
    apk add --no-cache \
        wget \
        ffmpeg


ENV N8N_HOST=${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}
ENV N8N_PORT=5678
ENV N8N_PROTOCOL=https
ENV NODE_ENV=production
ENV WEBHOOK_URL=https://${SUBDOMAIN}.${DOMAIN_NAME}/

# Switch back to the non-root user that n8n runs as (typically 'node')
USER node
```
