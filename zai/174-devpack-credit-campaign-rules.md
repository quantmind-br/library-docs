## 1. General Principles

* **Campaign Organizer**: This campaign is initiated and operated by the service provider of Z.ai Platform (hereinafter referred to as "we," "us," or the "Platform").
* **Campaign Purpose**: To reward users and enhance product experience, we are launching the "Invite Friends, Get Credits" campaign.
* **Campaign Nature**: This campaign offers incentive Credits. All Credits are preferential benefits provided by the Platform, **not cash, currency, or financial instruments**, and do not possess monetary attributes.
* **User Agreement**: By participating, you represent that you have **read, understood, and agreed** to be bound by these rules. We reserve the right to modify or adjust these rules based on laws, regulations, and operational needs. Changes will be announced on the campaign page in advance.

## 2. Benefits for Invited Users

* **Invitation Validity Period**:
  * Friends enter via referral link, log in on the event page to bind. Inviter gets bonus if friend completes first subscription payment within 72hrs. If friend clicks multiple links, reward goes to the last valid touchpoint inviter.
* **Instant Discount**:
  * Invited users who complete registration via a unique invitation link or code and **successfully pay for their first subscription to 【GLM Coding】 service exclusively** will enjoy a **10% instant discount** on the order amount (the discount amount will be directly deducted from the total amount payable).
  * **Important Payment Note**: Due to requirements of our payment processor (Stripe), the final amount payable **after applying all discounts and Credits must be at least 0.50 USD**. If the discount reduces the payable amount below 0.50 USD, the discount applied may be adjusted to ensure the minimum payment threshold is met.
* **Eligible Users**:
  * Only **newly registered users** of the Platform, or **existing registered users who have never had any paid subscription history**.
  * Each user (determined by mobile number or email address) can only enjoy the first-order discount **once as an invited user**.
* **Exclusions**:
  * This discount **applies only to the current initial subscription order**.
  * **Subsequent renewals, upgrades, downgrades, or any other follow-up subscription orders are NOT eligible** for this discount.
  * This discount cannot be stacked with other similar first-order discount campaigns on the Platform.

## 3. Benefits for Inviters

Inviting users (hereinafter "Inviter") can earn the following Credits rewards after successfully inviting friends (i.e., "Invited Users") who complete registration and their first valid payment:

* **Base Reward**:
  * For each successfully invited valid friend, the Inviter receives a Credits equivalent to **30% of the friend's first order Actual Payment Amount** (defined below).
  * There is **no upper limit** on the number of invites; rewards accumulate continuously.
* **Tiered Extra Reward**:
  * For **every cumulative 30** successfully invited valid friends, the Inviter receives an additional one-time Credits equivalent to **10% of the total Actual Payment Amount** from those 30 friends.
  * Extra rewards are calculated per "**round**" (each set of 30 invites). Rounds can repeat and accumulate without an upper limit.
* **Definition of "Actual Payment Amount"**:
  * Refers to **the final cash amount actually paid** by the Invited User for their first subscription order. This amount specifically includes payments made via cash balance in the account or third-party payment methods.
  * This amount **excludes** any reductions from coupons, discount codes, credits, points, cash rebates, or any other promotional benefits, **regardless of** any subsequent refunds.
* **Credits Nature & Usage**:
  * **Nature**: Credits are **non-cash** preferential benefits provided by the Platform.
  * **Usage**: Credits can only be used to offset the following consumption on Z.ai Platform:
  * Purchasing or renewing GLM Coding and other subscription services.
  * Purchasing virtual products like resource packs or feature expansion packs within the platform.
  * Paying for platform API call fees.
  * **Restrictions**: Credits are **non-refundable, non-transferable, non-giftable**, and **cannot be used to request refunds for subscription services**.
  * **Validity Period**: Credits are **long-term valid** unless the user account is deactivated or the Platform ceases operation. We reserve the right to adjust the Credits validity period based on business needs in the future, with 30 days' advance notice provided.

## 4. Important Notes & Risk Warnings

* **Validity Criteria & Single Account Principle**:
  * The **sole criterion** for a valid invitation is: The friend registers via the Inviter's **unique invitation link or code** and completes the first subscription payment without refund within the campaign period.
  * **Single Account Principle**: Each natural person may only use **one platform account** to participate. The Platform determines user identity based on multiple factors including **phone number, email address, device ID (e.g., IMEI/OAID/IMSI), IP address, etc. The same phone number, device, payment account, or network environment may be deemed the same user**.
  * The Platform's backend system records are the **sole and final basis** for determining invitation relationships, validity, and user identity. In case of discrepancy with user records, the system records prevail.
  * If you have objections regarding invitation records or Credits issuance, please contact customer service within **15 days** of the objection arising for investigation. Objections raised after this period will be considered waived.
* **User Information Authorization & Privacy**:
  * To facilitate invitation tracking, Credits distribution, and anti-fraud checks, you understand and authorize the Platform to process necessary account and information (e.g., account ID, registration time, device info, payment info) for you and your friends within the scope of this campaign.
  * The Platform will strictly adhere to its privacy policy to protect all users' personal information. Invitation relationship information will not be disclosed to third parties without user consent.
* **Violations & Penalties**:
  * Users must comply with the Platform's User Agreement, Terms of Service, Subscription Agreement, Top-Up Agreement, campaign rules, etc. **Any form of cheating, fraud, or disruption is strictly prohibited**, including but not limited to:
  * **Technical Cheating**: Using plugins, scripts, emulators, virtual location software, hacker tools, automated scripts, bulk registration tools, etc., to fake invitations, registrations, payments, or tamper with device/network data.
  * **False Info & Account Trading**: Using false information for registration/verification, infringing on third-party rights, buying/selling platform accounts.
  * **Artificial Engagement**: Paying for services, joining booster groups, or exchanging non-genuine social engagements to complete tasks.
  * **Disruption**: Launching network attacks, exploiting loopholes, bypassing security measures, or any activity disrupting normal platform operations.
  * **Account Association**: If any account is found involved in fraud/cheating, we reserve the right to **disqualify all associated accounts** from the campaign and **reclaim all rewards** earned through those accounts based on reasonable judgment.
  * **Penalties**: If users are found violating these rules per our risk control systems or reasonable judgment, we may take one or more actions **without prior notice**:
  * **Deduct** all issued but unused Credits; **Reclaim the cash value** of any consumed Credits.
  * **Restrict, freeze, or permanently ban** violating accounts.
  * **Permanently prohibit** violating and associated accounts from all current and future Platform campaigns and benefits.
  * **Reserve the right to claim compensation** for all direct/indirect losses caused (e.g., extra operational costs, reputational damage, recovery costs) and **report to authorities**.
  * **Pursue legal liability** for severe cases involving significant amounts or illegal activities.
* **Campaign Changes, Suspension, & Termination**:
  * We reserve the right to **adjust, pause, or terminate** this campaign early based on actual operations, laws, regulations, or force majeure, announced via our website, in-app messages, or other reasonable means. Users may not hold the Platform liable for such actions.
* **Final Interpretation Right**:
  * **To the extent permitted by law**, Z.ai Platform reserves the **final right to interpret** all terms, details, and reward distributions related to this campaign.
