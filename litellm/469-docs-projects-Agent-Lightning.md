[Agent Lightning](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning) is Microsoft's open-source framework for training and optimizing AI agents with Reinforcement Learning, Automatic Prompt Optimization, and Supervised Fine-tuning — with almost zero code changes.

It works with any agent framework including LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and CrewAI. Agent Lightning uses LiteLLM Proxy under the hood to route LLM requests and collect traces that power its training algorithms.
