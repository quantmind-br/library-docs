> pi can help you create pi packages. Ask it to bundle your extensions, skills, prompt templates, or themes.

# Pi Packages

Pi packages bundle extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes so you can share them through npm or git. Declare resources in `package.json` under the `pi` key, or use conventional directories.

## Install and Manage

> [!warning]
> Pi packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
pi install npm:@foo/bar@1.0.0
pi install git:github.com/user/repo@v1
pi install https://github.com/user/repo  # raw URLs work too
pi install /absolute/path/to/package
pi install ./relative/path/to/package

pi remove npm:@foo/bar
pi list                     # show installed packages from settings
pi update                   # update pi and all non-pinned packages
pi update --extensions      # update all non-pinned packages only
pi update --self            # update pi only
pi update --self --force    # reinstall pi even if current
pi update npm:@foo/bar      # update one package
pi update --extension npm:@foo/bar
```

By default, `install` and `remove` write to global settings (`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`). Use `-l` to write to project settings (`.pi/settings.json`) instead. Project settings can be shared with your team, and pi installs any missing packages automatically on startup.

To try a package without installing it, use `--extension` or `-e`. This installs to a temporary directory for the current run only:

```bash
pi -e npm:@foo/bar
pi -e git:github.com/user/repo
```

## Package Sources

### npm

```
npm:@scope/pkg@1.2.3
npm:pkg
```

- Versioned specs are pinned and skipped by package updates.
- Global installs use `npm install -g`.
- Project installs go under `.pi/npm/`.
- Set `npmCommand` in `settings.json` to pin npm package lookup to a specific wrapper command:

```json
{
  "npmCommand": ["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]
}
```

### git

```
git:github.com/user/repo@v1
git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1
https://github.com/user/repo@v1
ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1
```

- Without `git:` prefix, only protocol URLs are accepted (`https://`, `http://`, `ssh://`, `git://`).
- With `git:` prefix, shorthand formats are accepted, including `github.com/user/repo` and `git@github.com:user/repo`.
- HTTPS and SSH URLs both supported. SSH URLs use configured SSH keys automatically.
- Refs pin the package and skip package updates.
- Cloned to `~/.pi/agent/git/<host>/<path>` (global) or `.pi/git/<host>/<path>` (project).
- Runs `npm install` after clone or pull if `package.json` exists.

**SSH examples:**

```bash
# git@host:path shorthand (requires git: prefix)
pi install git:git@github.com:user/repo

# ssh:// protocol format
pi install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo

# With version ref
pi install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1.0.0
```

For non-interactive runs (e.g., CI), set `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` and `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` (e.g., `ssh -o BatchMode=yes -o ConnectTimeout=5`) to fail fast.

### Local Paths

```
/absolute/path/to/package
./relative/path/to/package
```

Local paths point to files or directories on disk and are added to settings without copying. Relative paths are resolved against the settings file they appear in. If the path is a file, it loads as a single extension. If it is a directory, pi loads resources using package rules.

## Creating a Pi Package

Add a `pi` manifest to `package.json` or use conventional directories. Include the `pi-package` keyword for discoverability.

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Paths are relative to the package root. Arrays support glob patterns and `!exclusions`.

### Gallery Metadata

The [package gallery](https://pi.dev/packages) displays packages tagged with `pi-package`. Add `video` or `image` fields to show a preview:

```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "keywords": ["pi-package"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "video": "https://example.com/demo.mp4",
    "image": "https://example.com/screenshot.png"
  }
}
```

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| `video` | MP4 only. Autoplays on hover on desktop. Clicking opens fullscreen player. |
| `image` | PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP. Static preview. |

If both are set, video takes precedence.

## Package Structure

### Convention Directories

If no `pi` manifest is present, pi auto-discovers resources from these directories:

| Directory | Loads |
|-----------|-------|
| `extensions/` | `.ts` and `.js` files |
| `skills/` | Recursively finds `SKILL.md` folders and loads top-level `.md` files |
| `prompts/` | `.md` files |
| `themes/` | `.json` files |

## Dependencies

Third party runtime dependencies belong in `dependencies` in `package.json`. When pi installs a package from npm or git, it runs `npm install`.

Pi bundles core packages for extensions and skills. If you import any of these, list them in `peerDependencies` with a `"*"` range and do not bundle them: `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-agent-core`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, `@mariozechner/pi-tui`, `typebox`.

Other pi packages must be bundled in your tarball. Add them to `dependencies` and `bundledDependencies`, then reference their resources through `node_modules/` paths:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "shitty-extensions": "^1.0.1"
  },
  "bundledDependencies": ["shitty-extensions"],
  "pi": {
    "extensions": ["extensions", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/extensions"],
    "skills": ["skills", "node_modules/shitty-extensions/skills"]
  }
}
```

## Package Filtering

Filter what a package loads using the object form in settings:

```json
{
  "packages": [
    "npm:simple-pkg",
    {
      "source": "npm:my-package",
      "extensions": ["extensions/*.ts", "!extensions/legacy.ts"],
      "skills": [],
      "prompts": ["prompts/review.md"],
      "themes": ["+themes/legacy.json"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `+path` and `-path` are exact paths relative to the package root.
- Omit a key to load all of that type.
- Use `[]` to load none of that type.
- `!pattern` excludes matches.
- `+path` force-includes an exact path.
- Filters layer on top of the manifest. They narrow down what is already allowed.

## Enable and Disable Resources

Use `pi config` to enable or disable extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes from installed packages and local directories. Works for both global (`~/.pi/agent`) and project (`.pi/`) scopes.

## Scope and Deduplication

Packages can appear in both global and project settings. If the same package appears in both, the project entry wins. Identity is determined by:

| Source | Identity |
|--------|----------|
| npm | Package name |
| git | Repository URL without ref |
| local | Resolved absolute path |

#pi-packages #extension-management #package-manifest
