## Trait Borrow

```rust
pub trait Borrow<Borrowed>where
    Borrowed: ?Sized,{
    // Required method
    fn borrow(&self) -> &Borrowed;
}
```

Expand description

A trait for borrowing data.

In Rust, it is common to provide different representations of a type for different use cases. For instance, storage location and management for a value can be specifically chosen as appropriate for a particular use via pointer types such as [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) or [`Rc<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/rc/struct.Rc.html). Beyond these generic wrappers that can be used with any type, some types provide optional facets providing potentially costly functionality. An example for such a type is [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/string/struct.String.html) which adds the ability to extend a string to the basic [`str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html "primitive str"). This requires keeping additional information unnecessary for a simple, immutable string.

These types provide access to the underlying data through references to the type of that data. They are said to be ‘borrowed as’ that type. For instance, a [`Box<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) can be borrowed as `T` while a [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/string/struct.String.html) can be borrowed as `str`.

Types express that they can be borrowed as some type `T` by implementing `Borrow<T>`, providing a reference to a `T` in the trait’s [`borrow`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html#tymethod.borrow "method std::borrow::Borrow::borrow") method. A type is free to borrow as several different types. If it wishes to mutably borrow as the type, allowing the underlying data to be modified, it can additionally implement [`BorrowMut<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/borrow/trait.BorrowMut.html "trait std::borrow::BorrowMut").

Further, when providing implementations for additional traits, it needs to be considered whether they should behave identically to those of the underlying type as a consequence of acting as a representation of that underlying type. Generic code typically uses `Borrow<T>` when it relies on the identical behavior of these additional trait implementations. These traits will likely appear as additional trait bounds.

In particular `Eq`, `Ord` and `Hash` must be equivalent for borrowed and owned values: `x.borrow() == y.borrow()` should give the same result as `x == y`.

If generic code merely needs to work for all types that can provide a reference to related type `T`, it is often better to use [`AsRef<T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/convert/trait.AsRef.html "trait std::convert::AsRef") as more types can safely implement it.

## [§](#examples)Examples

As a data collection, [`HashMap<K, V>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html) owns both keys and values. If the key’s actual data is wrapped in a managing type of some kind, it should, however, still be possible to search for a value using a reference to the key’s data. For instance, if the key is a string, then it is likely stored with the hash map as a [`String`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/string/struct.String.html), while it should be possible to search using a [`&str`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html "primitive str"). Thus, `insert` needs to operate on a `String` while `get` needs to be able to use a `&str`.

Slightly simplified, the relevant parts of `HashMap<K, V>` look like this:

```rust
use std::borrow::Borrow;
use std::hash::Hash;

pub struct HashMap<K, V> {
    // fields omitted
}

impl<K, V> HashMap<K, V> {
    pub fn insert(&self, key: K, value: V) -> Option<V>
    where K: Hash + Eq
    {
        // ...
    }

    pub fn get<Q>(&self, k: &Q) -> Option<&V>
    where
        K: Borrow<Q>,
        Q: Hash + Eq + ?Sized
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

The entire hash map is generic over a key type `K`. Because these keys are stored with the hash map, this type has to own the key’s data. When inserting a key-value pair, the map is given such a `K` and needs to find the correct hash bucket and check if the key is already present based on that `K`. It therefore requires `K: Hash + Eq`.

When searching for a value in the map, however, having to provide a reference to a `K` as the key to search for would require to always create such an owned value. For string keys, this would mean a `String` value needs to be created just for the search for cases where only a `str` is available.

Instead, the `get` method is generic over the type of the underlying key data, called `Q` in the method signature above. It states that `K` borrows as a `Q` by requiring that `K: Borrow<Q>`. By additionally requiring `Q: Hash + Eq`, it signals the requirement that `K` and `Q` have implementations of the `Hash` and `Eq` traits that produce identical results.

The implementation of `get` relies in particular on identical implementations of `Hash` by determining the key’s hash bucket by calling `Hash::hash` on the `Q` value even though it inserted the key based on the hash value calculated from the `K` value.

As a consequence, the hash map breaks if a `K` wrapping a `Q` value produces a different hash than `Q`. For instance, imagine you have a type that wraps a string but compares ASCII letters ignoring their case:

```rust
pub struct CaseInsensitiveString(String);

impl PartialEq for CaseInsensitiveString {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.0.eq_ignore_ascii_case(&other.0)
    }
}

impl Eq for CaseInsensitiveString { }
```

Because two equal values need to produce the same hash value, the implementation of `Hash` needs to ignore ASCII case, too:

```rust
impl Hash for CaseInsensitiveString {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
        for c in self.0.as_bytes() {
            c.to_ascii_lowercase().hash(state)
        }
    }
}
```

Can `CaseInsensitiveString` implement `Borrow<str>`? It certainly can provide a reference to a string slice via its contained owned string. But because its `Hash` implementation differs, it behaves differently from `str` and therefore must not, in fact, implement `Borrow<str>`. If it wants to allow others access to the underlying `str`, it can do that via `AsRef<str>` which doesn’t carry any extra requirements.
