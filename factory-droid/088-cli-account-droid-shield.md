# Droid Shield

> Automatic secret detection to prevent accidental exposure of credentials in your git commits and pushes.

## What is Droid Shield?

Droid Shield is a built-in security feature that automatically scans un-committed changes for potential secrets before committing and pushing them to remote. It acts as a safety net to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive credentials like API keys, tokens, and passwords in your version control history.

<Tip>
  **Looking for advanced protection?** [Droid Shield Plus](/cli/account/droid-shield-plus) provides AI-powered security scanning with prompt injection detection, enhanced secrets detection, and sensitive data protection. Available for enterprise customers.
</Tip>

## How Droid Shield Works

When you use Droid to perform `git commit` or `git push` operations, Droid Shield automatically:

1. **Scans the diff** - Analyzes only the lines being added (not removed or unchanged)
2. **Detects secrets** - Uses pattern matching to identify potential credentials
3. **Blocks execution** - Stops the git operation if secrets are detected
4. **Reports findings** - Shows exactly where potential secrets were found

<Note>
  Droid Shield only scans git operations performed through Droid. Manual git commands run outside of Droid are not affected.
</Note>

## What Droid Shield Detects

Droid Shield scans for a wide range of credential patterns, including:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API Keys & Tokens" icon="key">
    Factory API keys, GitHub tokens, GitLab tokens, npm tokens, and API keys from (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Stripe, SendGrid) and more.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Authentication Credentials" icon="user-lock">
    (e.g. JWT, OAuth, session tokens), and URLs with embedded credentials.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Private Keys" icon="file-shield">
    (e.g. SSH private keys, PGP keys, age secret keys, OpenSSH keys), and other cryptographic key formats.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Service-Specific Secrets" icon="cloud">
    (e.g. Slack webhooks and tokens, Twilio credentials, Mailchimp keys, Square OAuth secrets, Azure storage keys).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Detection Algorithm

Droid Shield uses smart pattern matching with randomness validation:

* **Pattern matching** - Identifies credentials by format
* **Randomness check** - Validates that captured values look like actual secrets
* **Context awareness** - Considers variable names and assignment patterns to reduce false positives

***

## When Droid Shield Activates

Droid Shield automatically activates during these git operations:

* **`git commit`** - Scans staged changes before creating the commit
* **`git push`** - Scans commits that would be pushed to the remote

<Warning>
  If secrets are detected, the git operation is blocked to prevent credential exposure. You'll need to remove the secrets before proceeding.
</Warning>

***

## Managing Droid Shield Settings

### In the CLI

You can toggle Droid Shield on or off through the settings menu:

1. Run `droid`
2. Enter `/settings`
3. Toggle **"Droid Shield"** setting
4. Changes take effect immediately

<Info>
  Droid Shield is **enabled by default** for your protection. We strongly recommend keeping it enabled.
</Info>

***

## What to Do if Secrets are Detected

When Droid Shield detects potential secrets, you'll see an error message like:

```
Droid-Shield has detected potential secrets in 2 location(s) across files:
src/config.ts, .env.example

If you would like to override, you can either:
1. Perform the commit/push yourself manually
2. Disable Droid Shield by running /settings and toggling the "Droid Shield" option
```

### Recommended Actions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review the findings">
    Carefully examine the files and lines mentioned to identify what was detected.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove the secrets">
    * Use environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials
    * Move secrets to secure credential stores
    * Add sensitive files to `.gitignore`
    * Use git filter-branch or BFG Repo-Cleaner if secrets were already committed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retry the operation">
    Once secrets are removed, run the git command again through Droid.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Never disable Droid Shield just to bypass the check.** Exposed credentials can lead to security breaches, unauthorized access, and compliance violations.
</Warning>

### If You Get a False Positive

Droid Shield uses conservative patterns to err on the side of caution. If you believe a detection is a false positive:

1. **Verify it's not a real secret** - Double-check that the value isn't sensitive
2. **Use a manual commit** - Perform the git operation yourself outside of Droid
3. **Report the pattern** - Contact [support@factory.ai](mailto:support@factory.ai) if you encounter recurring false positives

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use environment variables">
    Store all secrets in environment variables or secure credential managers, never hardcode them in source files.

    ```bash  theme={null}
    # Good - Using environment variable
    const apiKey = process.env.FACTORY_API_KEY;

    # Bad - Hardcoded secret
    const apiKey = "fk-abc123xyz789...";
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Keep Droid Shield enabled">
    Droid Shield provides an essential safety layer. Keep it enabled at all times, especially in team environments.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review before committing">
    Even with Droid Shield, manually review your changes before committing to ensure no sensitive data is included.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Educate your team">
    Make sure all team members understand how Droid Shield works and why it's important to keep it enabled.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

***

## Limitations

<Note>
  **Droid Shield is a detection tool, not a guarantee.** While it catches many common secret patterns, it cannot detect:

  * Custom secret formats not in the pattern database
  * Secrets that don't follow recognizable patterns
  * Obfuscated or encoded credentials
  * Business logic vulnerabilities or code security issues

  Always follow security best practices and never rely solely on automated tools for secret protection.
