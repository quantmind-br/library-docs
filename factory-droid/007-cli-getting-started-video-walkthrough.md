### config.json - Bring Your Own Key

Configure custom models using your own API keys:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "models": [
    {
      "provider": "openrouter",
      "name": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
      "apiKey": "your-api-key-here",
      "displayName": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet (OpenRouter)"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Provider Documentation">
    Visit [Bring Your Own Key documentation](/cli/byok/overview) and select your provider (OpenRouter, Fireworks, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy Configuration Template">
    Copy the JSON configuration for your chosen provider
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to config.json">
    Paste the configuration into `~/.factory/config.json` and add your API key
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Model">
    Use `/model` in the CLI to select your newly added model
  </Step>
</Steps>

[See all BYOK providers →](/cli/byok/overview)

### settings.json - Allow & Deny Lists

Configure which commands require approval in High autonomy mode:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "autoModeAllow": [],
  "autoModeDeny": [
    "git push",
    "rm -rf",
    "npm publish"
  ]
}
```

Even in High mode, commands in the `autoModeDeny` list will always require your explicit approval before execution.

### mcp.json - MCP Integrations

Enable or disable MCP tools individually:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"],
      "env": {
        "BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-playwright"],
      "disabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

Set `"disabled": true` to temporarily disable an MCP without removing its configuration.

## Custom Droids (Sub-Agents)

Custom droids are specialized AI agents that handle specific tasks. Access the droids menu with `/droids`:

### Managing Droids

* **Import** (`i`) - Import pre-built droids from other agents
* **Create** (`c`) - Create a new custom droid
* **Edit** - Modify existing droid configurations
* **Enable/Disable** - Toggle droids on or off

### Creating a Custom Droid

[Learn more about custom droids →](/cli/configuration/custom-droids)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Scope">
    Decide if the droid should be **project-level** (specific repository) or **personal** (available across all projects)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generation Method">
    Choose to create manually or generate with droid's help:

    ```
    I want a code review droid that checks for security issues and coding standards
    ```

    Droid will generate an appropriate description and configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Model">
    * **Inherit**: Use the same model as the parent session
    * **Specific Model**: Choose a dedicated model for this droid (e.g., use a reasoning model for complex analysis)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Tools">
    Select which tools and capabilities the droid should have access to
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save & Edit">
    Confirm the configuration and optionally edit the details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Use Cases

* **Code Review Droid** - Automated code reviews for pull requests
* **Documentation Droid** - Generates and maintains documentation
* **Test Generation Droid** - Creates comprehensive test suites
* **Security Audit Droid** - Scans for vulnerabilities and security issues

## MCP Integrations

Model Context Protocol (MCP) allows droid to integrate with external tools and data sources.

### Adding MCPs via CLI

Use the `/mcp add` command:

```bash  theme={null}
/mcp add
```

Then provide the MCP details:

* **Name**: Identifier for the MCP
* **Command**: Executable command (e.g., `npx`, `python`)
* **Args**: Command arguments
* **Environment Variables**: API keys and configuration

### Listing Configured MCPs

```bash  theme={null}
/mcp list
```

This shows all configured MCPs and their enabled/disabled status.

<Note>
  After adding or modifying MCPs, you may need to restart the CLI for changes to take effect.
</Note>

### Adding MCPs via Configuration File

You can also directly edit `~/.factory/mcp.json`:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/directory"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-token-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Popular MCP Integrations

* **Brave Search** - Web search capabilities
* **Playwright** - Browser automation
* **GitHub** - Repository and issue management
* **Filesystem** - Extended file system access
* **Postgres** - Database queries
* **Slack** - Team communication

## Example Workflow: Spec Mode to Implementation

Here's a complete workflow demonstrating droid's capabilities:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start in Spec Mode">
    Press `Shift + Tab` until you're in Spec mode

    ```
    Create an authentication system with GitHub and Google OAuth
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the Plan">
    Droid generates a detailed specification:

    * Architecture decisions
    * Files to create/modify
    * Dependencies needed
    * Implementation steps
  </Step>

  <Step title="Iterate on the Spec">
    Refine the plan before implementation:

    ```
    Change the plan to only include Github auth and not Google auth
    ```

    Droid updates the specification accordingly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve and Proceed">
    Once satisfied with the plan, proceed with High mode to implement
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Changes">
    Droid shows exactly what will change and waits for your approval
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Spec mode is especially powerful for complex features. It allows you to validate the approach before any code is written.
</Tip>
