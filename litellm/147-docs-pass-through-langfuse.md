Pass-through endpoints for Langfuse - call langfuse endpoints with LiteLLM Virtual Key.

Just replace `https://us.cloud.langfuse.com` with `LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL/langfuse` 🚀

#### **Example Usage**[​](#example-usage "Direct link to example-usage")

```
from langfuse import Langfuse

langfuse = Langfuse(
    host="http://localhost:4000/langfuse",# your litellm proxy endpoint
    public_key="anything",# no key required since this is a pass through
    secret_key="LITELLM_VIRTUAL_KEY",# no key required since this is a pass through
)

print("sending langfuse trace request")
trace = langfuse.trace(name="test-trace-litellm-proxy-passthrough")
print("flushing langfuse request")
langfuse.flush()

print("flushed langfuse request")
```

Supports **ALL** Langfuse Endpoints.

[**See All Langfuse Endpoints**](https://api.reference.langfuse.com/)

## Quick Start[​](#quick-start "Direct link to Quick Start")

Let's log a trace to Langfuse.

1. Add Langfuse Public/Private keys to environment

```
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=""
export LANGFUSE_PRIVATE_KEY=""
```

2. Start LiteLLM Proxy

```
litellm

# RUNNING on http://0.0.0.0:4000
```

3. Test it!

Let's log a trace to Langfuse!

```
from langfuse import Langfuse

langfuse = Langfuse(
    host="http://localhost:4000/langfuse",# your litellm proxy endpoint
    public_key="anything",# no key required since this is a pass through
    secret_key="anything",# no key required since this is a pass through
)

print("sending langfuse trace request")
trace = langfuse.trace(name="test-trace-litellm-proxy-passthrough")
print("flushing langfuse request")
langfuse.flush()

print("flushed langfuse request")
```

## Advanced - Use with Virtual Keys[​](#advanced---use-with-virtual-keys "Direct link to Advanced - Use with Virtual Keys")

Pre-requisites

- [Setup proxy with DB](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/virtual_keys#setup)

Use this, to avoid giving developers the raw Google AI Studio key, but still letting them use Google AI Studio endpoints.

### Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

1. Setup environment

```
export DATABASE_URL=""
export LITELLM_MASTER_KEY=""
export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=""
export LANGFUSE_PRIVATE_KEY=""
```

```
litellm

# RUNNING on http://0.0.0.0:4000
```

2. Generate virtual key

```
curl -X POST 'http://0.0.0.0:4000/key/generate' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer sk-1234' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{}'
```

Expected Response

```
{
    ...
    "key": "sk-1234ewknldferwedojwojw"
}
```

3. Test it!

```
from langfuse import Langfuse

langfuse = Langfuse(
    host="http://localhost:4000/langfuse",# your litellm proxy endpoint
    public_key="anything",# no key required since this is a pass through
    secret_key="sk-1234ewknldferwedojwojw",# no key required since this is a pass through
)

print("sending langfuse trace request")
trace = langfuse.trace(name="test-trace-litellm-proxy-passthrough")
print("flushing langfuse request")
langfuse.flush()

print("flushed langfuse request")
```

## [Advanced - Log to separate langfuse projects (by key/team)](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/proxy/team_logging)[​](#advanced---log-to-separate-langfuse-projects-by-keyteam "Direct link to advanced---log-to-separate-langfuse-projects-by-keyteam")
