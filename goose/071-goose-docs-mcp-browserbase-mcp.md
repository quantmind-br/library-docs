This tutorial covers how to add the Browserbase MCP Server as a goose extension for browser automation, enabling programmatic control over navigation, page interactions, and content capture.

Let's use the Browserbase extension to gather information about trending MCP-related repositories on GitHub.

```
1. Go to https://github.com/trending

2. Search for "MCP server" or scroll through and find repos with "MCP" or "Model Context Protocol" in the title or description

3. For the top 3 relevant repositories:
    • Click into the repo
    • Take a screenshot of the repo page
    • Extract:
        - Repo name
        - Description
        - Stars today
        - First paragraph of README 
    • Navigate back

- Close all tabs

- Output a Markdown report showing:
    • Repo name (link)
    • Screenshot
    • Description + Stars
    • README excerpt
```

```
