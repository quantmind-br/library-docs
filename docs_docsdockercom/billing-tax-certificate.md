If you're a customer in the United States and are exempt from sales tax, you can submit a valid tax exemption certificate to Docker Support.

If you're a global customer subject to VAT, make sure to include your [VAT number](https://docs.docker.com/billing/history/#include-your-vat-number-on-your-invoice) along with your country prefix when you update your billing profile.

For United States customers, Docker began collecting sales tax on July 1, 2024. For European customers, Docker began collecting VAT on March 1, 2025. For United Kingdom customers, Docker began collecting VAT on May 1, 2025.

To ensure that tax assessments are correct, make sure that your [billing information](https://docs.docker.com/billing/details/) and VAT/Tax ID, if applicable, are updated. If you're exempt from sales tax, see [Register a tax certificate](https://docs.docker.com/billing/tax-certificate/).

Docker's support team will reach out to you if any additional information is required. You'll receive an e-mail confirmation from Docker once your tax exemption status is applied to your account.
