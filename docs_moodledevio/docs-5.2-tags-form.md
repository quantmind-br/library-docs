## [Choice Dropdown](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/subsystems/form/fields/choicedropdown)

The choicedropdown form field creates a dropdown list with multiple options. It is different from a standard select dropdown in that each option can have extra icons and descriptions. This field is often used in forms to facilitate the selection of a non-trivial option that demands additional information.

## [Form Usage](https://moodledev.io/docs/5.2/apis/subsystems/form/usage)

Moodle's Form API is an extension of the Pear HTMLQuickForm API, which is no longer supported. Some documentation for the upstream library is available in the PEAR package page, including a short tutorial. A longer tutorial is also available, courtesy of the Internet Archive.
